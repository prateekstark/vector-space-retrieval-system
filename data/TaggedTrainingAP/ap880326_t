 A state weight inspector whose boss says he tipped the scales at 500 pounds himself and `` kept growing out of the uniforms'' is appealing his firing by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wahpeton </LOCATION>, who is awaiting a hearing before the state <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, was given five reasons in writing for being fired, including his weight, his lawyer, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutsman </PERSON>, said Friday. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> was dismissed July 31 from his job in a scale house where he weighed trucks and inspected cargo. `` To say we terminated the guy because he was overweight is basically unfair,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel bad for the guy. We tried to work with him to improve his situation. He left us no alternative, in our opinion.'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s `` weight probably contributed to other things. ... Personal health habits would be a polite way of saying it.'' Highway Patrol policy requires employees to maintain `` appropriate health levels, weight levels and physical fitness levels'' as determined by the department's doctor, personnel officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnost </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anagnost </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> was informed that reasons for his firing included his failure to follow the doctor's recommendations about weight loss, his appearance and grooming and his inability to wear a uniform while on duty. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> weighed 325 in 1983 and 500 pounds when he was fired, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. `` He kept growing out of the uniforms. We refused to keep altering them.'' <PERSON> Stutsman </PERSON> refused to discuss details of the appeal, and <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> referred all questions to his lawyer when contacted Friday. <PERSON> Stutsman </PERSON> called <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> a `` fairly good-sized man, that's for sure,'' but he said his client's weight is disputed, in part because `` they have never really had an adequate scale to weigh him on.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, in his 40s, had worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> since 1977 in the agency's truck regulatory division, <PERSON> Stutsman </PERSON> said. His exact age was unavailable.

<HEAD>New Alaska Tourism Ads Poke Fun at Texas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fighting an image that <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is cold and forsaken all year, the state tourism division is running new TV ads that get a little good-natured revenge by poking fun at its big-state rival, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Four years ago, former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he did n't believe anyone would want to visit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which he called a frozen wasteland, said state tourism marketing director <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Klugherz </PERSON> `` We basically took that page from history'' in making the series of six commercials, <PERSON> Klugherz </PERSON> said. In the commercials, a governor visits <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to see for himself why people come here. The governor's state is not identified, `` but you can tell he's from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Klugherz </PERSON> said. `` He's sort of an LBJ look-alike.'' The governor also wears a 10-gallon hat and cowboy boots. The first commercial shows the governor visiting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and discovering the summer weather is great. The second ad says the governor's aides are coming north to look for him because he apparently has decided he enjoys it in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> so much he stayed longer than expected. People still believe <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> endures cold, snow and ice all year, said <PERSON> Klugherz </PERSON>. `` We're trying to tell travelers the truth,'' she said. July temperatures in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> average in the high 50s, with daytime temperatures often in the 60 - to 70-degree range In past ad campaigns, tourism officials have pitched the state's scenery and wildlife, <PERSON> Klugherz </PERSON> said This year, `` We're basically hitting the weather head-on,'' she said. The tourism division is spending $ 2.3 million to air the commercials on network stations in 20 cities in the Lower 48. The ads started running last month and will continue through April, <PERSON> Klugherz </PERSON> said. The ads will not run in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> because it's too expensive to advertise there, she said.

<HEAD>Stock Market Finishes Worst Week of Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market closed out its worst week so far this year, as prices fell for the second straight session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 44.92 points Friday to 1,978.95, finishing the week with a net loss of 108.42. That marked the average's biggest weekly decline since it dropped 143.74 points last Nov. 30-Dec. 4 After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed signs of steadying Friday. Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit. But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since late last year. In the absence of any news to explain the market's weakness, brokers said many traders remained fearful that economic and inflationary pressures might soon reach a point where they would prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to begin tightening credit. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in the daily tally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 385 up, 1,156 down and 428 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 163.17 million shares, against 184.91 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index lost 2.42 to 146.58. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 39.81 billion, or 1.52 percent, in value.

<HEAD>Nation Posts Record Deaths, Most Births in 23 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The aging of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s population led to a national record of 2.1 million deaths last year, but births topped 3.8 million for the highest number in 23 years, the government says. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that deaths in 1987 totaled `` 2,127,000, about 28,000 more than the previous year and the largest number ever reported for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Deaths from heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, slipped slightly, but cancer claimed more victims than in the year before, the study showed. The nation's overall death rate was about the same as in 1986, at about 8.7 deaths per 1,000 people. That's because the number of fatalities increased at about the same rate as the population grew, the study noted. The study also found that marriage and divorce rates changed little, remaining at relatively low levels. Births, which had dipped somewhat in 1986, climbed 3 percent the following year to an estimated 3,829,000. `` The 1987 provisional total is the largest number reported since 1964,'' the study said. The fertility rate was 66.1 live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, up from 64.9 in 1986. The rising number of births that have occurred in recent years has resulted from the large number of women born during the post World War II Baby Boom who have now entered their main child-bearing years. That has prompted population experts to term the recent rise in births an echo of the Baby Boom. They insist it is not, in itself, another Baby Boom, however, pointing out that birth rates have remained well below those of the 1950s and early 1960s. Subtracting deaths from births, the study reported a natural increase in population of 1,702,000 people last year, 3 percent more than in 1986. Just slightly over twice as many couples married as were divorced during the year, the annual report found. Marriages in 1987 totaled 2,421,000, 1 percent more than the year before. That represented a marriage rate of 9.9 per 1,000 population. That was the lowest rate since 1977, when it was also 9.9. Meanwhile, there were 1,157,000 divorces last year, a 1 percent decline. The divorce rate was 4.8 per 1,000 people, about the same as the year before and the lowest divorce rate since 1975. The report also looked at causes of death reported across the nation, and found a decline in heart disease fatalities, but an increase in cancer deaths between 1986 and 1987. Because it takes longer to compile the detailed figures, the cause-of-death statistics were reported for the 12-month period ending with November 1987, rather than for the calendar year. For all causes, the 1987 rate was reported at 873.0 deaths per 100,000 people, down from 873.3 in 1986. The rate for major cardiovascular diseases slipped from 401.8 per 100,000 in 1986 to 395.7 in 1987, the study said. But at the same time, the death rate for all types of cancer increased from 193.7 per 100,000 to 195.9. Among the other causes of death reported were diabetes, 15.4 per 100,000, up from 15.2; stroke, 61.0, down from 61.6; pneumonia and influenza, 28.2, down from 28.7; chronic lung disease, 31.7, up from 31.3; chronic liver disease, 10.7, down from 10.8; accidents, 38.1, down from 38.9, and suicide, 12.1, down from 12.6.

<HEAD>Pentagon To Unveil Buy-American Regulations For Bearings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Willson is cq.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will try to prop up the slumping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing industry with a requirement that makers of jets, submarines and other military systems use only American-made bearings. The `` Buy-American'' regulation, due to be published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, would be in place for at least three years, said Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., who pushed for the rule She called it a `` tremendous victory'' for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing makers. The domestic industry has been severely eroded by foreign competition in recent years. Nearly 65 percent of ball bearings sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> come from abroad, and 40 percent of the roller bearing sales are from imports. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is a major buyer of bearings, making up nearly 19 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> buys a majority of the super-precision bearings used in jets and submarines. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> proponents warn that the sagging domestic industry would be unable to gear up for wartime production. They point to a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study that said the bearing industry is critical to the nation's defense and warned that domestic manufacturers were in `` imminent danger of being unable to support national defense needs.'' `` This action is clearly needed to halt a trend that directly jeopardizes our ability to defend ourselves,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> whose western <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> district includes several major bearing employers. `` This new policy will prevent the loss of even more business overseas and give our bearings companies the breathing room they need to regain their competitive edge,'' she said. The new regulations would cover only combat-related systems and not non-military items bought by the Pentagon such as bearings for automobiles, according to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Willson </PERSON>. Military bearings make up more than half the bearings purchased by the department. About $ 40 million of the $ 350 million in military-related bearings purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> annually comes from foreign countries. And that trend has been increasing, the congresswoman said. From 1980 to 1986, she said, the number of foreign manufacturers authorized to sell bearings to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> increased from two to 12. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that would have climbed to 30 companies by 1990 without the new regulations. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and other industrial-area lawmakers are supporting an industry request to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urging restrictions on foreign imports. The department has until July to respond to last summer's request and make a recommendation to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Since 1980, the industry has lost 15,000 jobs, a 20 percent decrease. Thirty plant closings have left about 80 companies remaining and 43,000 employees, Ms. <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> said.

 Critics say President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> interfered with the legal process by predicting that former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> will be acquitted of charges in the Iran-Contra affair. In off-the-cuff remarks Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the affair `` the so-called scandal'' and said he still considers North `` a hero.'' But he refused to say whether he was considering granting any pardons in the case. `` I just have to believe that they're going to be found innocent because I do n't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any crime,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in response to a question at a seminar sponsored by the Center for the Study of the Presidency. North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, along with arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of conspiracy, theft and fraud in the Iran-Contra case. The case involved the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment about the innocence or guilt of people under criminal indictment `` is highly inappropriate `` His statement could adversely and improperly influence the execution of justice,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> told reporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has contributed to a prejudicial climate which could make it extremely difficult to get an unbiased jury in these cases,'' he said. `` The president has made a judgment about guilt or innocence which only a jury is supposed to decide under our system of justice.'' Professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks `` highly inappropriate'' and said they could influence jurors in the case. `` Millions of people feel strongly in favor of the president and his views carry great weight. He has an awful lot of credibility,'' said <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON>, a consumer advocate who has been associated with liberal causes. `` This is prejudging the case.'' In 1970, defense lawyers unsuccessfully sought dismissal of murder charges against <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> after then-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> `` was guilty directly or indirectly of eight murders without reason.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> subsequently issued a statement saying he had not intended to proclaim <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> guilty, and that a person was presumed innocent until proven otherwise. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, questioned about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks, said, `` He's a man who tells you what he thinks and that's what he thinks.'' He said the president was `` a man of rare insight and perception, just giving his perception there.'' White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> described the president's remarks as `` personal views,'' and said the president's `` official position is that the system must operate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that when he learned that proceeds from the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been channeled to the Contra cause, he had top aides brief congressional leaders and appointed a commission to probe the matter. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also noted that he had sought the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the diversion. `` Now, that's the whole extent of the so-called scandal,'' he said. `` What our intent was and what happened. And you know something? After all the investigations, today I still do n't know who got that extra money or where it came from. I'm hoping to find out.'' `` But I wanted you to know that I have some definite reason for still thinking <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is a hero,'' he added. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> previously had said he did not think any laws were broken in the Iran-Contra affair, but had never gone so far as to predict acquittals.

<HEAD>Green Light Given For 475,000-Ton Wheat Sale To Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Five private exporters have been given the green light for subsidized sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of 475,000 metric tons of hard red winter wheat, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has approved in-kind bonuses averaging $ 21.95 a ton in value to the exporters to send the wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in May, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Friday. Under the Export Enhancement Program, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, grain companies and other exporters receive government-owned crops as bonuses to spur overseas sales of American commodities. Subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled more than 10.8 million tons since last April, officials said. And the program is playing an increasingly large role in the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm export picture. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, identified those receiving the bonuses and the amounts of grain involved as <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Artfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons. The Soviets may still purchase an additional 525,000 tons under a 2 million ton offer made by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Jan. 29. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also made the Soviets a further 1 million-ton offer on Saturday. The two countries are preparing to negotiate a new long-term grain agreement to replace the one that expires Sept. 30. It calls for the Soviets to buy 9 million metric tons a year, of which 4 million must be wheat and 4 million corn. The remainder may be in wheat, corn, soybeans or soybean meal, with every ton of beans or meal counting as two tons of grain. Despite the agreement wheat sales to the Soviets slumped badly in 1986 but picked up against last year as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave that country the green light for purchases under the subsidy program.

 Giveaways of government surplus milk to poor people are set to resume temporarily in June after a planned suspension in May, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Just how long the distribution of nonfat dry milk under the <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> can continue beyond June remains uncertain, the department said in a statement Friday. Suspension of the nonfat dry milk and cheese distributions was announced in February amid dwindling stocks of government-owned commodities. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inventories, however, have again climbed to the point that 8 million pounds can be distributed through local food banks in June, the department said. `` At this time, we do not know if distribution of non-fat dry milk can be continued beyond June,'' Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> said in a statement. He said the department would `` monitor our inventories and keep states informed of availability.'' `` The same is true for cheese,'' he said. `` If we get more, we'll give it away.'' Also announced in February was a suspension of rice and honey distributions this month because of declining reserves. The actions have drawn fire from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., is holding hearings on the problem of hunger and focusing on the TEFAP He planned a grocery-bagging session at a downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> food bank on Monday to draw attention to the issue. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement of June milk distribution that he was `` pleased that there's an additional temporary supply for the month but this does not address the long-term problem.'' More than 5 billion pounds of surplus food worth more than $ 5 billion has been distributed since 1981 when the program got under way on orders from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the department said. Seven types of goods have been provided: cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, honey corn meal, flour and rice.

 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has set a May referendum for cattle producers and cattle and beef importers on whether to continue their current $ 1 per head promotional program. The department announced Friday that anyone who produces cattle or has imported beef or beef products since Oct. 1, 1986, will be eligible to vote. A simple majority of votes will determine whether to continue the promotions, which have included television spots by actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. `` Real food for real people'' has been the slogan of the commercials. The referendum will take place on May 10 in all states except <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where the voting will be one day earlier. Extension Service offices will distribute ballots in April and absentee ballots will be available from them by mail. The program is funded by a fee of $ 1 per head on all domestic and imported cattle and an equivalent fee on beef imports. It was established under federal legislation approved in 1985.

 Republican conservatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are wary of the Nicaraguan cease-fire, with one saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to `` take some action with external forces'' if the Contra rebels quit the field. `` It's down to that,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, R-Wash. `` It's definitely a new era <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> was among <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conservatives attending a retreat Friday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` there is reason to have caution'' about whether <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government will keep its agreements <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments were his first statement in any detail on the 60-day nationwide cease-fire announced Wednesday in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, by leaders of the Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra guerrilla force. `` Of course we look forward to this and hope it continues, but ... just as in some other meetings that have gone on in which I have been involved, I think that we should keep in mind that both parties must be dedicated to the things that are said and agreed to in those meetings,'' the president said. `` I think there is reason to have caution _ they have a past record that indicates that we should be,'' he added. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was questioned by reporters as he prepared to meet with President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. In a formal statement as he appeared with <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> in the Rose Garden after the meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commended the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> president for hosting previous Nicaraguan peace talks, mediated by Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo. `` We both hope for democratic and peaceful solutions to the problems of the region,'' he said. `` We want to see an end to the pursuit of military solutions and to the massive Soviet armament that fuels that pursuit.'' During his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing earlier, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration believes `` that this agreement has been reached by both sides in good faith'' but is `` skeptical of the compliance.'' `` We're very hopeful that it works,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We want to do whatever we can to see that it works.'' The spokesman also said the administration is `` very hopeful'' that a package of humanitarian assistance to the Contras can be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Easter recess. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no intention of entering into direct discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, as suggested by Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` We've discussed that two years,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The answer is no.'' At the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> retreat, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said that if the Contras fold their tents and it is `` back to the usual Sandinista behavior'' of totalitarian rule, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to `` take some action with external forces ... external, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who has co-sponsored a plan to renew military aid to the Contras, said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the meantime to approve rapidly some new humanitarian support for the Contras with the option of adding military aid if things turn sour. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, other conservatives criticized the agreement, but appeared willing to put the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the test and wait to see whether promised democratic reforms materialize. `` It's an agreement that's shaded on the bad side,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` A sense of euphoria is not in order ... I do n't believe I've ever heard of a leopard changing his spots.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said, `` The end product of what they've agreed to still leaves a Soviet puppet state in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, whose death at age 60 leaves open a powerful congressional post, was a widely admired lawmaker who loved a good legislative scrap almost as much as he loved golf. The 60-year-old Democrat died Friday, a day after suffering a heart attack on a suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> golf course, his office said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, influential chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, succumbed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> here at 1:46 p.m., said aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallen </PERSON>. A Roman Catholic funeral was planned for Tuesday in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s office said the <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> lawmaker died `` of complications arising from a heart attack ... from which his heart never fully recovered.'' They did not elaborate. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a 22-year House veteran, was stricken Thursday while playing the first hole of a morning round of golf. `` His last memory was that he was wearing Irish green and hit a great shot that landed him on the green in two,'' said his daughter <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, who was with him at the time. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, and their two other daughters also were with him. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., recalled <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s fondness for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother, the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` The last time I saw him, last week, he asked me for another PT-109 tie clip, and we reminisced again about <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s 1960 campaign,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said in a statement. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said of Howard: `` He worked hard, played hard, loved his family, his state and his country with a burning intensity.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was one of his first friends in politics. `` He leaves a great legacy of accomplishments,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was known among colleagues as one of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s toughest horse traders. He was an aggressive and agile lawmaker who wielded his considerable clout in an old-fashioned, behind-the-scenes way. The committee he headed since 1981 is one of the least glamorous but most powerful in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It has jurisdiction over multibillion dollar highway and water projects, as well as the airline and trucking industries. Once in 1985, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lawmakers mounted a plan to legalize dumping of their state's sewage off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast. Suddenly, money for a much sought-after <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> tunnel slipped to the bottom of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda. Elected in 1964, he rose to become the second most senior member of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressional delegation after Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who says he will not seek re-election. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> represented the 3rd Congressional District along <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s central shorefront. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, is in line to succeed <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> Any new chairman must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus.

<HEAD>Salamander Tunnel Fails First Test</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lone salamander made its way through a tunnel built to prevent cars from crushing the amphibians during their annual trek across a street in this college town. `` It was an historic event. It was the first salamander to go through a tunnel all on its own,'' <LOCATION> Shutesbury </LOCATION> school teacher <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said Friday. But 39 other salamanders bypassed the tunnels, to the dismay of onlookers. Fifty people turned out on a drizzly Thursday night to watch the salamanders cross <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> to reach a breeding pond _ a route that results in death for many of the creatures each spring. The watchers ended up barricading the street and carrying about 40 of the struggling yellow-spotted amphibians across the road. The tunnels installed for the salamanders under the street were ignored by all but the one. Shouts went up when the salamander was discovered crawling along a fence leading to one of the tunnels. The creature made it through in 5 minutes, 20 seconds, said <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, who lives about a mile from the street. The salamander tunnels were installed after a public outcry over the amphibians' plight. Local naturalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> persuaded town officials to close the street last year until all the salamanders had emerged from their underground hibernation to make the nighttime trek during warm rains, which usually takes a week. The three 19-inch-high tunnels of polymer concrete were donated by ACO Polymer Products of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and installed in November for about $ 2,000. Volunteers erected fences in January to guide the salamanders to the tunnels. The fences failed their first test, but townspeople said it was too early to tell how the experiment would fare. `` There were very few salamanders out, probably because there's not enough of a saturation rate yet to rouse the rest of the population,'' said <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> Townspeople had different theories to explain why all but one of the salamanders bypassed the tunnels. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, who also coordinated a contest for `` Salamander Crossing'' sings, said the salamanders might have been hibernating between the fence and the road. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Minear </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>, said the tunnels may not have been wet enough for the salamanders' liking. The town's superintendent of public works said he is in the process of hanging the crossing signs, designed by <LOCATION> Shutesbury </LOCATION> fourth-grader <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON> sang the title role in <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s `` Lulu'' for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday night. She sang it well, leaving only the question of whether the luminous lyric quality of her soprano voice will survive a role composed with so many shrieks on top and such angular intervals. She is singing all six performances, which includes the Saturday afternoon radio broadcast of April 2. Tenor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, made his Met debut as <PERSON> Alwa </PERSON> on Friday night. `` Lulu'' is a difficult opera in which to judge voices but <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> certainly coped with the very high range of a fairly large but thankless role. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazura </PERSON> was excellent as Dr. <PERSON> Schon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alwa </PERSON>'s father. <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyanos </PERSON> was properly self-sacrificing as the Countess. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> conducted, with the orchestra sometimes at times overpowering the singers. The <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> production, from 1977, captures the decadence of the story in which everybody falls for <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON>, some to die of suicide, murder or shock. The Met performed `` Lulu'' for the first time in 1977 and performed it with the third act added, making it a four-hour evening, for the first time in 1980.

 A federal appeals court will hear arguments May 6 on whether to dismiss a contempt ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for its attempt to sell its <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> shuttle. The hearing date was set Friday, when the court also refused a request by Eastern to block a set of sanctions levied against the carrier. The ruling by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> means <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, at least temporarily, will have to halt its efforts to sell the shuttle while it conducts a legal battle with its largest labor union. Judges <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> all voted to deny <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request to drop the sanctions. On March 10, District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> found Eastern in contempt for trying to sell its shuttle for $ 225 million. Eastern, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, proposed selling the shuttle to a new company to be created within <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> found that the proposed sale violated an order he issued last July that Eastern not change the working conditions of its 12,000 employees represented by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Company officials had said Eastern was in the red and needed the cash from the sale, but union leaders said the deal really was intended to weaken the labor organization. Monday, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> ruled that until the case was settled, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would have to halt all efforts to gain government approval of the shuttle sale. The judge also threatened to fine the airline $ 10,000 daily for future violations. Under Friday's ruling, the sanctions will remain in place until <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal of the contempt ruling is decided.

<HEAD>U.S. Halting Stingers To Afghan Rebels In Anticipation Of
Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is halting its supply of Stinger missiles to the Afghan rebels because of concern the weapons could be left to Afghan factions that could n't be controlled if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military ties were severed, according to a published report today. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, citing diplomatic and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources that it did not identify, also reported that the administration is rushing at least $ 300 million in other weapons to the resistance before an agreement is reached that would ban such outside assistance. Among the U.S.-purchased military equipment being rushed to the resistance are 120mm Spanish heavy mortars and modern mine-clearing weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The decision to stop supplying the anti-aircraft Stingers apparently was reached late last month in anticipation of a peace settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. `` Certainly we would not want the war to end with a lot of them unused,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a strong supporter of the resistance who said he did not know if a decision had been made to stop supplying the Stingers. Last month, an Afghan guerrilla commander either sold or was forced to hand over some Stingers to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Pieces of a Stinger were found on an Iranian gunboat involved in a shooting incident with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter helping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escort mission in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last October. The Afghan rebels started receiving the Stingers in mid-1986 and they reportedly have gotten more than 1,000 of them, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. A withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a major topic discussed during this past week's visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Two Cubic Workers Accused Of Falsifying Mine Detector Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees were charged Friday with falsifying test results on hand-held mine detectors produced for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In announcing the indictment, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> also said that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-based </LOCATION> defense contractor had agreed to pay the government $ 7.25 million to settle a civil suit stemming from the allegations. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Tullahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent in federal court Friday to conspiracy to defraud the government, making false statements and submitting false claims for payment. Each of the 24 counts in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. Cubic held a $ 9 million Army contract to produce and retrofit more than 8,500 detectors designed to locate mines in arid soil. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the devices were never used in combat by American forces. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> was the senior associate engineer on the technical staff, while <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> was the program manager for Cubic Defense Systems on the contract signed in 1981. Before full-scale production could begin, Cubic had to demonstrate that it could mass produce mine-detectors that worked as effectively as earlier prototypes, the indictment said. The indictment alleged that the test results were falsified so that the mine detectors appeared to function better than they really did. As a result of the false information, the indictment said, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> gave approval for full-scale production but terminated the contract in 1984 because of equipment faults. In the civil suit, prosecutors alleged Cubic knowingly presented false claims for payment because some company officials were aware that the detectors had failed the tests. Under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, Cubic company will remain a government contractor. `` Since the events leading to the indictment, Cubic has taken the necessary steps to avoid a recurrence of similar conduct,'' <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has failed for the first time to pay the 15,000 troops supporting him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic crisis deepens and the opposition promises more confrontation. Also Friday, the civilian government that acts for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> threatened to revoke stores' licenses unless they stop observing a week-long general strike and open to sell such essentials as food, medicine and gasoline. The strike has shut down more than 90 percent of the nation's commerce Cash and food are in short supply. The opposition, meanwhile, said it was planning massive street anti-Noriega demonstrations for Monday that appeared likely to trigger a confrontation with troops loyal to the general. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, once again claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in a desire to hold on to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, is behind his country's troubles `` A man is not the problem,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said of himself on Friday. `` The problem is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s canal and the presence of a foreign army in our territory.'' In an attempt to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into exile, the White House has had Panamanian deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks frozen and payments for use of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> withheld. The former canal zone is headquarters to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> Under a 1977 treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will cede control of the canal by the year 2000. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied any connections with drug-trafficking pilots whose testimony led to his indictments last month, and joked about reports he wields a $ 200 million fortune: `` Bring it to me, bring it to me and I'll pay off <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign debt.'' He implied force might be used to make the nation's banks re-open. On Thursday, they refused to hand over an estimated $ 70 million in their vaults so the government could pay the army on Friday, pensioners Monday, and 130,000 public employees over the next week. Banks have refused to open, partly to support the general strike and partly because they fear a panic run on their deposits. `` Those who understand such things consider it necessary to open the banks,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. Opposition leaders said they hoped <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s soldiers would stop supporting him now that they have joined the 2.5 million Panamanians who have gone without pay for up to a month. But the anti-Noriega umbrella group, The National Civic Crusade, suffered a surprising blow Friday when <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> failed to issue an expected statement strongly condemning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and supporting Monday's planned demonstration. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, who had met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Thursday, would only say on Friday that he planned to meet with again with the general, who heads <PERSON> Panamana </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, ended a two-day fact-finding trip Friday saying he was `` still hopeful that at some time the Church will be able to make a statement that will bring a happier remedy than we have seen so far.'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa., issued a statement saying `` there is absolute unanimity that Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go, and that his departure is only a function of time. That sentiment was echoed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 92-0 to demand that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> increase economic sanctions to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. In the former canal zone, wives of the mostly American ship pilots who guide vessels through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> _ and could shut the waterway down if they went on strike _ demonstrated in front of the joint U.S.-Panamanian commission that runs the canal. They complained they were being harassed by Panamanian troops who set up roadblocks at intersections across <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, questioning motorists and searching their cars. `` We feel like we are hostages within the political crisis because we feel unsafe going into town,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsson </PERSON>, wife of a canal pilot. The problem was apparently resolved later Friday, but the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the commission refused to say what arrangements were made.

<HEAD>Fiscal Survey Finds Most States Sound But Close To Financial Edge</HEAD>

 A new `` Fiscal Survey of the States'' finds that most states tightened their budget belts last year and are reluctant to start major new programs this year because of uncertainty about the economy. The report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says most states are in sound financial shape, although states such as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are facing tough financial times because of their reliance on the troubled energy industry. Most states, however, are close to the financial edge, according to the report released Friday. It found that the majority of states will end the year with only small budget balances. Those balances are expected to fall to 1.5 percent of total expenditures at the end of next fiscal year, the lowest level since the recession of 1983, when it was 1.3 percent.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Donilda </PERSON>, teachers at government high schools who have n't been paid since mid-month, are selling bootleg beer to feed themselves and their three children. They eat only twice a day. Even so, they are luckier than one neighbor in the poor <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> neighborhood in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> hills on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who had sent her children out to steal. As the opposition exerts pressure to oust strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and cash grows increasingly scarce, many Panamanians are relying on donated food to stay alive. Families have sent their children to stay with relatives in the countryside, where fresh milk and produce is at least more readily available than in the capital. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON>, who insisted on not being further identified for fear of reprisal, said several stores in his neighborhood, mostly owned by Panamanians of Chinese descent, have been robbed during the past couple of weeks. `` People are not stealing money, they are stealing food,'' he said. `` This woman the other day told her kids to go in that store and grab some milk. When the owner came chasing after them, she faced him with a big stick and told him her kids had to eat and she would kill him if he tried to stop them.'' `` What do we tell the kids we are teaching?'' <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> asked. `` We have suffered years of bad government in this country,'' he said of 20 years under military rule. `` I am not very political, but things must change ... <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure would be the beginning of the political solution.'' The general, who heads the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, seeking to force him out, has frozen virtually all <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s funds in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, including <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> tolls, the country's main source of revenue. Since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s currency, the cash shortage became doubly acute. Most of the country's 118 banks have been closed for three weeks, some for longer. There have been street demonstrations, some of them violent, and a general strike has paralyzed the nation since Monday. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has dug in his heels and refuses to leave. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> and his wife, together normally net $ 170 a month after deductions for taxes and payments on a government-financed mortgage on their three-bedroom concrete block home. Each got their last paycheck _ for $ 75 _ on March 15. It was the last time the government paid employees, and many did n't get anything. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> used to make about $ 40 more a month refereeing soccer matches. But the games have n't been played since the crisis began. There is no money. A strong, wiry man with a mustache and a tiny tuft of beard on his chin, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> held his restless 4-year-old son <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>, trying to quiet him. `` We make adjustments, we survive,'' he said. That morning, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> and his family had oatmeal, some cheese and bread for breakfast. <PERSON> Donilda </PERSON> was planning to cook some fish and rice for lunch. But there would be `` some tea and bread only in the evening,'' she said. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> said he had n't paid his light and water bills. With the schools closed until further notice, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> spends his time doing odd jobs around the house, training his 12-year-old daughter <LOCATION> Zulia </LOCATION> and other kids in the neighborhood in track and field. And he digs into his savings, buying American bootleg beer and cigarettes which he resells, making about $ 4 profit on each case of beer. `` A lot of people are doing that. People will always buy beer,'' he explained, sweating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s tropical heat. A few blocks away, several hundred people stood in line outside the <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redeemer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has been donating bags of food and running a soup kitchen for the destitute.

 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> strongly criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for stressing might over diplomacy in its Central American policy _ at a high cost in death and destruction. `` We oppose the justification for acts of intervention or economic coercion'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he said Friday during a state dinner for visiting President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. `` The protection of our security is n't associated with strategic projects of doubtful standing,'' he added in comments clearly aimed at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration though not mentioning the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by name. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> held two rounds of private talks Friday in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s own interests in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are jeopardized by instability in the region, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> declared in the rare attack on his country's northern neighbor. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> perceives the overflow of the Central American conflict as a risk affecting its legitimate interests and provoking disorder and instability that threaten our institutions,'' he said. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> referred to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financing of the Contra rebels who have been fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government for six years and the dispatch of 3,200 American troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on March 17 after an alleged incursion by Nicaraguan troops chasing Contra fighters. Military sources in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are going home Monday, now that a <LOCATION> Sandinsta-Contra </LOCATION> truce is holding with the two sides' agreement Wednesday to cease hostilities and seek to forge a lasting peace. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> also criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that are aimed at forcing the ouster of that country's military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Stubbornness in imposing military options over diplomatic efforts is producing a conflict whose high costs in death and destruction we can neither tolerate nor view with indifference,'' the president said. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> first voiced criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the region Monday, when he said `` it is not with the movement of troops, nor with the financing of subversion from whatever origin that the problems of the area which is vital to the interests of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> people are resolved.'' Conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stems from economic and social causes, he said, declaring that his nation would search for solutions that `` guarantee the legitimate interests'' of the region. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> and de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> were scheduled to conclude their talks today.

Col. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. The object, which was `` larger than a railroad boxcar,'' re-entered the atmosphere around 10:50 p.m. CST, <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said. The chances of it causing any damage on the ground were highly improbable, he said. `` When an object like that re-enters, it breaks up in the atmosphere, and you have these smaller pieces and sometimes you have quite a show,'' <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said. The re-entry was seen in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> had been tracking the object by satellite, he said. `` We knew this was going to re-enter, but exactly where was hard to predict, as far as the exact time and location,'' he said. Most of the phone calls about the fiery re-entry came from the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> areas, but the object was seen as far away as <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecke </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist who operates a weather station from his home in <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, said the object looked like a meteorite to him. `` It was closer and larger than anything I've ever seen anything before, and I've been real active watching the skies since 1963,'' <PERSON> Hecke </PERSON> said. He said he called a number of radio stations after the sighting and said it had been seen in <LOCATION> Lawton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. Cars along Interstate 35 pulled off the road to watch the fireworks, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribble </PERSON>, a newsman for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> who was driving on the interstate when he saw the re-entry He said it looked like the sparks caused by a car whose muffler has come loose and is dragging along the roadway. `` It just kept growing, like a sparkler,'' said <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>, a 33-year-old technical writer for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` It went across the entire sky.''

<HEAD>Condos Threaten Ancient Craft As Sweetgrass Disappears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The ancient art of weaving baskets from sweetgrass, brought over from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by slaves and passed down for generations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Lowcountry, is threatened by the modern-day condominium. Booming coastal development of the past 20 years is reducing the availability of the sweetgrass favored by local artisans for the baskets, a popular purchase for tourists, folklorists said. `` What's at stake is the continuation of this traditional African craft,'' said <PERSON> Myrtle </PERSON> <PERSON> Glascoe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Avery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Afro-American History at the College of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` If people ca n't get the grass, they wo n't continue to do the craft.'' A conference on the problem was scheduled for today at the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>. Basket weavers, government officials, historians and others were invited to attend. Weavers have seen their access to local sweetgrass decline in recent years, and have been forced to buy it from as far away as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It's getting scarce,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, a basket weaver from nearby <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>. `` People are building condominiums all over and they do n't want you to go on their property.'' The preferred type of grass for the ornamental baskets, Muhlenbergia filipes, generally grows in the sand beyond the dune line at the beach _ the area that has been developed extensively in recent years. `` The grass is still there and certainly not all of it has been built over,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosengarten </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKissick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` But many of the areas in which it grows are restricted entry.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said that, in addition to the access problem, there seems to be less sweetgrass available in areas still open to gathering. Mrs. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said she buys some of her grass from suppliers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but even that is not without problems. Once, two men who supply her with the grass were arrested for gathering it, she said. Some local artisans have resorted to making their baskets from bulrushes, which are n't as pliable or bright as sweetgrass. `` You ca n't make a small basket with a bulrush because the bulrush wo n't bend as easily,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who operates a family basket stand in Mount Pleasant which her grandmother operated before her. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosengarten </PERSON> said the economic impact of basket sales is probably slight. But she said it's hard to gauge their importance to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s tourism economy because visitors remember the historic city as one of pastel houses, horse-drawn carriages _ and basket weavers. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosengarten </PERSON> said there are a number of things that can be done. The <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> has a plot of land where officials hope to cultivate sweetgrass. `` We'd like to see the -LRB- commercial -RRB- nurseries carrying the grass and to see it used as an ornamental,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rosengarten </PERSON> said. `` We want people to be aware of the grass and what it is. It's great for holding the dune'' against erosion. `` We're trying to take action before it's too late,'' she added, noting that if the sweetgrass becomes an endangered species, no one, including the basket weavers, would be able to pick it.

 Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, saying `` I can read the numbers,'' admits his race for the White House is all but over, as Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> faces the prospect that today's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses could write the end to his campaign. The Democratic hopefuls searched <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for every last vote Friday, with front-runners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> exhorting their backers to ignore the polls and make a final push for victory. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> closed his campaign with a noisy gathering at a Polish-American center in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wrapped up his day with thunderous rallies across the state. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told supporters in a series of stops that he can pull off a stunning upset here. Despite showing some late strength, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman was still third in the polls and aides were talking about a race for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. `` We will pull off a miracle in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told a crowd in <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Neither Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> nor fellow Democratic contender, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, had made significant organizational and advertising efforts in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Both have spent more time in the upcoming primary states where they saw better chances for a breakthrough. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> stunned a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> audience with a frank admission that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is almost certainly the Republican nominee. `` I can read the numbers and I know probably what's going to happen,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> told reporters after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the group. Asked if he would continue until the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on April 5, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had this to say: `` I may tell you that later this week, probably next week.'' But a spokesman was quick to deny that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was conceding the race. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s comments wo n't change any of his plans. `` This does n't say it's over. So I'm going to just keep going right down to the wire and not speculate on somebody else's campaign or on the Democratic side,'' he said after a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside questions about potential running mates as well. `` It's too early for me to start thinking about any running mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I do n't want to do.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was asked on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'' if he would accept the vice presidency if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned to him. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he did not believe he would be the choice, but when pressed, he said: `` You know, most of my adult life I've spent in public service, and if someone asked me to do it, I would have a very difficult time trying to figure out what I was going to say. `` But I do not wish that to happen. I do not think that will happen, and I do not expect it.'' The Democratic spotlight was on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the latest in the series of big-state primaries that may decide the party's 1988 nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, leading in the delegate count for the nomination, hoped his strength across the state would give him a large share of the 135 delegates at stake as well as the popular vote victory. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, making a joke about his heavy, dark eyebrows, asked his people to work hard in the final hours. `` When you make those phone calls tonight and tomorrow _ and I hope you will because you know in caucuses particularly turnout is very important _ you just tell them to go with the guy with the eyebrows and we'll have a very good Saturday,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. At his side were Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> named rivals <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and said he was outspent 50-to-1 by them in the South `` yet we got the most votes.'' `` If they had my budget, they would surrender. If I had their budget, they could not compete,'' he said. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke at a Baptist church where the crowd was so large that people stood outside unable to get in. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> began suggesting that the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on April 5 will be where he tries again to win one from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who he suggested are more liberal than he. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> took the opportunity of a question on his defense ideas to restate his claim to be the moderate among the Democrats. `` It's not conservative. I've never used that word. Let me hasten to add, you do n't have to be very far to the right to be to the right of this crowd,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a slim lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the AP delegate count, with 548.55 votes to 520.55 for the civil rights leaders. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 362.8 votes, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 154 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 171.5. A total of 354.6 votes are currently in the uncommitted column.

<HEAD>Bar Becomes Symbol for `Preppie' Lifestyle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On Aug. 25, 1986, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> was just another bar on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> catering to the young and upwardly mobile: a hangout for yuppies and preppies, where the Izod crowd came to knock back a few. Twenty-four hours later, all that changed. With the death of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> early on the morning of Aug. 26, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s became _ fairly or unfairly _ a symbol of youthful decadence, of teen-agers with too much money and no place to go. Among them was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who sat at the bar drinking shots of tequila with beer chasers the night he killed Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. `` He fouled everybody's life up,'' bar owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> `` Jack'' <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> said recently. `` Who needs this guy?'' After Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death, investigators returned to <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s and closed the bar for 10 days for serving underage patrons in November 1986 <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> has put the bar up for sale; no buyer has been found. Chambers, now 21, had been a regular at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s. He also was a college dropout who had a very proper upbringing. Dinner at the Chambers house, located next to the former <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> mansion a few blocks north of <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s, `` always had silver involved,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Destino </PERSON>, a friend of Chambers, shortly after Chambers' arrest. Chambers apparently had no steady job at the time of his arrest, yet was drinking and flirting `` five or six nights a week'' at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s, said its owner. Interviews in the months since the slaying indicate that <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s remains attractive, a place where young people can gather in front of an ornate fireplace and play backgammon at the tables. Regulars said they avoided <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s after Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> died, fearing the bar had been taken over by the curious. But the young men and women who grew up in the wealthy neighborhood and knew one another in the best prep schools came back. Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> was not a regular at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s but was known there. Patrons do n't talk much about the case, they said. `` I come here when I feel like sitting around like I'm in my living room,'' said <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Donati </PERSON>, 21, who said she has been frequenting <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s for five years. <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> himself knows who's who in the bar; he can point out the child of a well-known writer and the daughter of a presidential adviser. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of ex-Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, was tending bar the night of the death. Chambers would no longer be welcome, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> said. Other regulars would say tourists, out-of-towners and the curious are not welcome either. `` Parents like their kids to come here,'' Miss <PERSON> Donati </PERSON> said. `` Here they know the people are from at least good families, they've been to good colleges, and they're not out to rape people.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, defending himself against charges he misused $ 80,000 from a protocol fund, said he was never told it was public money and was given carte blanche to do nearly anything he wanted with it. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> testified at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial Friday that when the proceeds of his inaugural ball were converted into a protocol fund, nobody questioned whether it should be considered public money instead of private. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, taking the stand for the second time in his trial, said inaugural committee Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> told him, `` We've gone through all of this rigamarole'' in determining that the inaugural funds could not be used to pay off campaign debts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Long </PERSON> told him, `` ` You can spend it for any damn thing you want' _ those are his words _ ` except you ca n't spend it for politics or for personal living expenses.''' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused of misusing $ 80,000 from the $ 92,000 protocol fund by loaning it to his car dealership, <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>. The governor is scheduled to resume testifying Monday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has testified on the first charge against him: that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state employee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin hearing testimony next week on the third charge: that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, also faces a recall election May 17 and an April 21 criminal trial on six felony charges of hiding the $ 350,000 loan. The prosecution contends the protocol fund was state money, and that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontiac </PERSON> needed the loan to meet its July payroll. A prosecution witness testified earlier this week that the dealership had about $ 3.7 million in loans against an appraised value of $ 3.35 million. Prosecutors have said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to conceal the $ 80,000 loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his 37-year-old son, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who has been the dealership's general manager since his father ran for governor in 1986, sought to paint a rosier financial picture. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he borrowed the money simply because his father offered it in an effort to get a higher interest rate for the protocol fund. He said he could always use additional capital in an effort to generate more profits. `` The rumor mill has been rampant about <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> since day one. We've had our lives, every scrap of it, demonstrated to our competitors ... and <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his angels,'' the younger <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> led the governor through a series of calculations that he said showed that <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> had $ 2.5 million worth of unencumbered property. Later, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> told reporters, `` The numbers are obvious. There was at least $ 2.5 million worth of real estate value behind an $ 80,000 loan. I'll take that deal anytime.'' However, the governor acknowledged that in July 1987 _ the same month the $ 80,000 loan was made _ he was notified that he was behind on repaying a $ 101,905 loan from <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` Quite frankly, I was n't watching my details,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. `` I was a little red-faced when this caught up with me.'' He said he paid part of the loan and refinanced the rest in a transaction handled by telephone. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, and lawmakers also could decide to bar him from holding any future office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in six decades.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON>, the acclaimed choreographer whose vision created the Joffrey Ballet and made it one of the nation's foremost dance companies, has died after a lengthy illness. He was 57. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> died early Friday at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of liver, kidney and respiratory failure, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Terrie </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCicero </PERSON> said. As artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet for three decades, <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> guided the troupe from its early days as a struggling six-member company traveling in a borrowed station wagon to international acclaim. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> brought an unbridled passion for ballet in every form to our profession,'' said <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, artistic director of the American Ballet Theater. `` His love of the heritage of ballet was an inspiration to everyone,'' <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> said. `` He was also committed to seeking out new choreographers and often was not afraid to put the most untried choreographers on a ballet stage for the first time. We salute his taste and his ingenuity.'' The Joffrey Ballet, appearing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, dedicated Friday night's performance to its founder. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> became ill in April 1986. He was diagnosed as having severe myositis, which causes deterioration of the muscles, enlarged liver and asthma. Medication that he was receiving for asthma and the muscle condition caused his fatal liver ailment, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Pennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said. Because of his asthma, a doctor had recommended that <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> take up dancing as a 9-year-old to improve his health. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anver </PERSON> <PERSON> Bey </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Dec. 24, 1930, the son of an Italian mother and an Afghan father. He started dance classes in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, also studied at the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and studied with two modern-dance teachers. His short performance career began with a solo concert of his own works in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He danced with <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>'s Ballets de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1949; from 1950 to 1952 he sometimes danced in the concert group of one of his teachers, <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. The Robert Joffrey Ballet Concert performed at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YMHA </LOCATION> in 1954, but <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> dated the founding of his company to 1956, when he taught six dancers four pieces he had choreographed and sent them on an 11-state tour in a borrowed station wagon. Within 10 years of that tour, the <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballet </PERSON> had performed at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The Joffrey now ranks with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and American Ballet Theater as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s big three ballet companies. `` He had a passion and a love for dance. He loved to bring dance to parts of the world that had never seen it,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chryst </PERSON>, a member of the Joffrey troupe for 11 years and one of its best-known dancers. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> was one of a handful of artists who made their personal visions into a public statement. The company he started will continue to bring that vision to audiences all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, managing director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>. Among <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON>'s accomplishments was his recreation of Vaslov <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>'s 1913 `` The Rite of Spring.'' <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> engaged two dance historians to recreate the ballet, danced only eight times previously. It premiered in September 1987 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. His own ballets include `` The Nutcracker'' in 1987 and his striking 1967 `` Astarte,'' in which a couple dance in front of a billowing white silk curtain on which a movie of them dancing is projected. He left no immediate survivors. The funeral will be private. A memorial service will be scheduled later.

 The nation's largest opposition coalition praised the <LOCATION> Sandinista-Contra </LOCATION> peace accord but assailed the government's pact to negotiate political reform with a small segment of the opposition. In other developments Friday, the Sandinista government's newspaper <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said citizens should now prepare for ideological warfare And the U.S.-supported Contra rebels indicated they would resume fighting if reconciliation talks do n't achieve greater political freedom. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said a 5-day-old cease-fire appeared to be holding. The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, a coalition of four leading political parties, two labor unions and professional and business organizations, said Wednesday's peace accord represented `` positive advances to obtain real and effective peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' But the coalition rejected the ` National Dialogue'' agreement the leftist government signed two days earlier with eight smaller political parties not affiliated with the Coordinate. In a statement, it called the agreement `` contrary to the interest of the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in their efforts -LRB- to promote -RRB- democratization and freedom.'' By signing the pact, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> sought to separate negotiations on democratic reform from talks with the Contras, the Coordinate said. The Sandinistas and Contras agreed Wednesday to maintain their cease-fire until June 1, hoping negotiations to begin April 6 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> will by then have forged a lasting peace. The Contras agreed not to accept any more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. Under the agreement, reached in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised a gradual amnesty and unrestricted freedom of expression that would allow the Contras a role in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s political process. But the Contras' future political role is unclear _ and that concerns the Coordinate. Under the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement, up to eight Contra leaders would be allowed to participate in the so-called National Dialogue. <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON>, Coordinate vice president, said he hoped Contras will begin a `` tripartite dialogue'' with the government and the Coordinate. The National Dialogue, begun in October with 15 opposition parties, reached an impasse two months later when the government refused to discuss opposition proposals for modifying a new constitution that went into effect in January. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Huembes </PERSON>, president of the Coordinate, said Friday that domestic economic and political pressures, as well as international opinion, had forced the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the negotiating table. `` We all know about the decomposition and lack of political pluralism existing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. We all know and understand the economic crisis the Sandinista government is foundering in and the lack of international credibility and aid that the Sandinista front has lost,'' he said. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said in an editorial that the cease-fire agreement means the 6-year-old civil war will enter a new phase: `` On an internal political level, this means the incorporation of pressure groups, that even though disarmed, continue to be armed ideologically against the popular power and its conquests.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, a Contra spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, indicated that if democracy is not achieved through the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> accords, the Contras could renew their armed fight: `` If we ca n't do it peacefully, if the Sandinsitas do not want to achieve democracy, then the reasons Nicaraguans took up arms will still be there.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Huembes </PERSON>, president of the Coordinate, said Friday that domestic economic and political pressures, as well as international opinion, had forced the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the negotiating table. `` We all know about the decomposition and lack of political pluralism existing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. We all know and understand the economic crisis the Sandinista government is foundering in and the lack of international credibility and aid that the Sandinista front has lost,'' he said.

 The 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to counter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s alleged military incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> will return home Monday after an 11-day stay, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials said. On Friday, the light infantry and paratroopers continued joint training exercises with Honduran troops at four bases throughout the country, said Cap. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLoche </PERSON>, a public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> Air Base. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the soldiers from the 7th Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division, sent to <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> March 17 `` will begin redeploying from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to their home bases in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Monday.'' Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> had asked for the troops after Sandinista troops allegedly crossed the border in pursuit of Contra rebels. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leaders signed an agreement to continue until June 1 a cease-fire that began Monday with the hope they can forge a lasting peace.

Calm prevailed along the border on Friday, government officials said. `` It's peaceful on the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> because there are no Nicaraguan troops,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Lisandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesado </PERSON>. At the height of the alleged incursion, Sandinista troops penetrated an area of about 36 square miles in the border province of <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> during their pursuit of more than 1,000 Contra fighters, Honduran military intelligence sources said.

 A young Irishman, in jail on a murder charge while the woman who crossed an ocean to see him lies comatose, says he hopes they still can have a life together. `` I'm scared out of my wits,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, 21, said in a telephone interview Friday from the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, where he is being held on a murder charge that could bring the death penalty if he is convicted. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, who flew from her home in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to see <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> in jail, remains in a coma at <ORGANIZATION> Weiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after being hit by a car on St. Patrick's Day. She is in critical condition. `` I hope that one day I should walk away from this and make a life for both of us,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> met in August 1987, when <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where his mother lives and he lived briefly. Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, 22, was an actress for <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' father, a theater company owner in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. That's where their love story began. `` I met her the very day I got off the plane. She was over at my house. She came over on her tea break because she and my sister are best friends,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> recalled. Romance `` was in the air,'' he said. `` We got very serious after a couple of weeks. We found that we were very compatible.'' But <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a cabinetmaker, found hard economic times in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, so he returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in November. On Dec. 29, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was charged with bludgeoning his landlord to death in the man's apartment, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney's office. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> allegedly took hundreds of dollars and the man's car before fleeing, she said. He is charged with first-degree murder, residential burglary, armed robbery, home invasion, armed violence, and possession of stolen motor vehicle, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, who declined to discuss the case, pleaded innocent and has a pretrial hearing scheduled for March 31. Despite the murder charge, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' sister <PERSON> Susie </PERSON>, 20, flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Feb. 23. Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> knew <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was in jail, but wanted to help him, he said. She wrote him letters `` saying that no matter what, she wanted to be there for me,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. Their reunion at the jail `` was very emotional,'' he said. `` I think she was more or less speechless. `` I was delighted, I was overwhelmed because it proved something to me ... that a woman willing to travel 1,000 miles to see me must be worth keeping.'' But he said `` the emotional stress of seeing me behind bars'' was hard for Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> to accept. She called her family, telling them she planned to return home March 18. `` She said she'd explain it all to us later,'' said her father, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>. But she was hit by the car March 17. Her parents flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after the accident and have kept a vigil at their daughter's bedside. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said he still hopes he and Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> will be together again. `` I'm madly in love with her. There's something there that no other woman has shown,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will send a team of experts to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> next week to examine victims of poison gas attacks blamed on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that killed thousands of people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the chemical attacks have been aimed at Kurdish rebels in a portion of northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims to have captured. A Kurdish leader asked Friday for medical aid for the victims. In a related development Friday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would send a special emissary to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for talks on seeking an end to the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had requested the talks and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> decision to send the team to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was an apparent compromise. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> had accused the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> of foot-dragging on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s request for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission to investigate allegations <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons on Kurdish rebels, in violation of international agreements. He had indicated that lack of action on the request could lead to delays in reaching a cease-fire, as called for in a July resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It means if the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> remains inactive regarding all aspects of the war, a political solution would be more and more difficult,'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> told a news conference. A Kurdish rebel leader appealed for urgent medical aid for Kurdish villagers he said were affected by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> poison gas attacks this week. `` The situation is getting desperate as we do not have any facilities to cope,'' said a statement issued by the office of <PERSON> Massud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>'s Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The statement claimed at least 50 Kurdish villagers were killed and scores wounded in the last such chemical weapons attack Thursday, when Iraqi planes bombed <PERSON> Seyo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Senan </PERSON> villages in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The villages are near <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 5,000 Kurds died last week after an alleged <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raid with internationally banned poison gas bombs. After late-afternoon consultations with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> announced that the expert mission would arrive in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Monday and an Iranian emissary would meet with the secretary-general in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had been hesitant to send a team to the scene of the purported attack because it is in Iraqi territory now held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has not granted permission for such a mission to visit its territory. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has investigated and condemned <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using chemical weapons in previous years, but those incidents occurred on Iranian territory. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to send a special envoy for talks April 4-5. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> would not say when the Iranian emissary would meet with the secretary-general. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s spokesman, confirmed the two-person team, including a doctor, will be sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to see chemical attack victims. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was responsible was the gas attacks, but <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Friday that it appeared <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> was at fault. `` Sadly, there is considerable and most serious evidence in the public domain that chemical weapons have again been used by Iraqi forces in the past few days, causing a high number of casualties, including civilians of both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Massud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>'s party and the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government with Iranian support in recent years, seeking autonomy for the 3.5 million Iraqi Kurds. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been condemned by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on four previous occasions since 1984 for using chemical weapons in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> says the newly signed cease-fire pact with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> is an `` acid test'' of the Nicaraguan government's sincerity, and the rebels will keep their weapons just in case. `` We're not signing off any leverage, any power,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said Friday on his return from <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the pact was signed. `` We're keeping our weapons,'' he said. `` We are n't simply letting things develop any other way except the way they're signed. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, one of three top rebels who signed the preliminary peace accord Wednesday in hopes of ending the bitter seven-year civil war, acknowledged his skepticism toward the Sandinista government. `` We feel this is the acid test that will bring the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the moment of truth,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` If they do n't comply, it will be very difficult for anyone to believe them. `` We have the right to break this accord if they do n't comply,'' he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Nicaraugan exiles living in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> have expressed doubt that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led government will live up to the agreement. Some exiles have criticized the rebel leadership for negotiating the truce. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenal </PERSON>, a former vice president of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> it would be `` political suicide'' for the rebels to turn in their weapons before the country was fully democratic. `` There is no guarantee, just a Sandinista promise,'' <PERSON> Cardenal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the decision to sign the agreement was one that had to be made, whether or not the exiles favored it. `` This is a good decision,'' he told a news conference at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We had the courage to make it ... and strength to make sure that if it fails, we can hold our own.'' The Nicaraguan Resistance, a Contra umbrella group, was completely behind the agreement, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` I think all this talk on the local radio stations that we've sold out to the Sandinistas, I do n't think we have,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON> `` Some exiles do n't really understand the situation well.'' The resistance assembly, which regularly meets to discuss developments, began a three-day, closed-door conference here Friday and planned to review the nine-point agreement signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON> said. Under the peace accord, the temporary truce now in effect would run into a 60-day cease-fire starting April 1. On Monday, government and rebel commissions will meet to designate zones the rebels will occupy for the 60 days. As Contras move into the zones, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will begin releasing political prisoners including Contras and former members of the pre-revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Negotiations are to resume April 6 on a permanent cease-fire, including terms of rebel disarmament.

 Police and firefighters declared victory and ended a two-day sick-out after city officials agreed to meet with them and appoint a commission to investigate workers' wage complaints The `` blue flu'' began Thursday after the city announced a 2 percent pay raise for city employees to take effect July 1. Police and firefighters complained the raise was inadequate and would be devoured by higher city garbage fees that would be used in part to fund the pay raises. The officers and firefighters ignored back-to-work orders from the city council, mayor and a circuit judge, but began returning to work Friday afternoon. Officers will meet with five city council members Monday to discuss their grievances, said police Cpl. <PERSON> Monon </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of the Fraternal Order of Police chapter. `` We got what we wanted _ a meeting with the council,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We have n't discussed money yet, but we feel we're worth more than 2 percent.'' Officers are hoping for a 5 percent pay increase, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. But Mayor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said there was no money for larger raises. `` Let them come forward and show me where the money is,'' he added. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> ordered police and firefighters to end their walkout and threatened to fire those who ignored the order. But Patrolman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the threat had no effect on the decision to return to work. `` I think they're eager to come back,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. `` It took a lot for us to take off work. We did n't come back because the mayor said to. If we did n't come back for a circuit judge, we would n't come back for the mayor.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> added, `` We think we got our point across.'' After the walkout ended, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> lifted a civil emergency declaration he issued Thursday. Firefighters and police who returned to work faced no punishment, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said, but must have a doctor's excuse. Officers who had been off the job said they were collecting the required excuses. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he visited a doctor Thursday to obtain an excuse because of `` an old, nagging backache.'' `` I think everyone will have a doctor's excuse,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The city budget, approved Monday, includes appropriations for 165 policemen, 147 firefighters and 10 paramedics. The 2 percent raise averages $ 438 per employee annually, city officials say. Salaries for uniformed police officers range from $ 18,589 for a patrol officer with three years' experience to $ 27,673 for a captain with 20 years' experience. City firefighters' pay ranges from $ 18,409 for a first-year firefighter to $ 27,673 for an assistant fire chief with 20 years' experience

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wants to develop <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first commercial spaceport here, but the project faces a number of hurdles and an uncertain future. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Friday that he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> next week for $ 500,000 for a feasibility study of the project called <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He was vague about how the spaceport would be developed and operated, saying only that `` we feel with the money we can acquire the necessary consultation and advice.'' If the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approves the money, part of a supplemental budget request, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> will seek bids on a feasibility study that would begin in July. However, legislative leaders already have warned they expect difficulty finding money for new programs in the 1988 session beginning April 5. The governor spoke Friday to about 80 aerospace executives and legislative leaders outside the Space Museum at the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Station. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the facilities at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> and the adjacent Kennedy Space Center give <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> a clear advantage over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and other states contemplating developing facilities for commercial launches. `` We have the tracking systems, the launch pads, the support services, and most importantly we have the people to make <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> a reality,'' he said. Asked how a commercial customer would benefit from going to <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> rather than dealing directly with a rocket maker, as is done now, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> replied, `` Maybe our role is to provide the opportunities for the companies to do business. `` We could guarantee them a launch date months in advance,'' he added. Before reporters could ask how, he cut off questioning. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> have launch pad priority. It is doubtful <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> could guarantee a launch date unless it builds its own launch pads, control centers and tracking facilities, an expensive undertaking. All launch facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are controlled by the federal government, and commercial payloads such as communications satellites have to compete for rocket space with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> launches. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> launches have been scarce since the space shuttle Challenger and two major unmanned rockets exploded in 1986. This has created a huge backlog of payloads, and the military and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will have priority when shuttle flights resume, now scheduled for August. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is building a new family of unmanned rockets, but these are also heavly booked by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and commercial customers dealing directly with rocket makers. Many American companies are seeking launch services from the Europeans and Japanese, but those launch pads also are crowded. `` Because of the backlog of commercial payloads, there is a great demand in the private sector for launch facilities,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` Our goal is to launch one commercial mission each month from <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` At the current rate of $ 45 million per launch, this would directly inject $ 540 million per year into our state's economy.'' He predicted the spaceport also would attract much of the private sector space industry, which he projected would be worth $ 60 billion by the end of the century.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s finance minister says the government's $ 71.2 billion budget will run a multibillion-dollar deficit for a third straight year despite plans to impose new taxes, issue more treasury bonds and slash spending And in a speech today, Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> warned the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` wining and dining and giving gifts out of public funds have become a bane to society.'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingqian </PERSON>, addressing the congress Friday, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s deficit in 1988 will be 8 billion yuan -LRB- $ 2.2 billion -RRB-, the same as in 1987 and up slightly from 1986. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> urged greater controls over government taxing and finances, saying tax evasion, withholding of profits, extortion and doctored accounts have led to `` loss of an enormous amount of state revenue and ... also sabotaged party policies and principles.'' He said substantial revenues are needed as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> transforms its socialist economy to a more market-oriented model and strives for rapid economic growth. `` It therefore will be hard to eliminate the deficit within the next two or three years,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said, speaking on the second day of the annual congress, which is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature. In his speech Friday, Acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must make greater efforts to control inflation and increase agricultural production as it forges ahead with economic reforms. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said state revenues rose 6 percent in 1987 to $ 63.4 billion while expenditures also rose 6 percent to $ 65.6 billion. The draft budget for 1988 calls for revenues of $ 69 billion. He said $ 3.5 billion in revenues will come from foreign loans, up from $ 2.8 billion in 1987, and that increased revenues will also be sought by imposing a new tax on land use in urban areas. In addition, state treasury bonds worth $ 2.4 billion will be issued, $ 811 million more than last year. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said the government will continue to suppress spending on capital construction and hold down administrative costs, steps taken after overall spending jumped 20.1 percent in 1985. He said the state will substantially boost spending in agriculture, up 14.6 percent in 1988 to $ 4.2 billion. Officials have stressed the need for more investment in rural areas following several years of listless grain production and a trend among individual farmers to use profits to build houses and buy TVs rather than further develop their land. The budget for capital construction is slated to fall about 4.5 percent to $ 17.1 billion; education, science and public health is to receive $ 12 billion, up 15 percent; and defense is allotted $ 5.8 billion, up 5 percent. <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, asked high-spending officials to remember `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is as yet very underdeveloped economically, with numerous tasks to undertake and inadequate funds and materials.'' He outlined four goals for 1988, topped by the promotion of agriculture production. <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will continue to reform its pricing system so that prices, now kept artificially low by government subsidies, better reflect market values. Local authorities will provide direct subsidies to workers to help compensate for price rises of those foodstuffs that are rationed, he said. The second goal is building up the nation's infrastructure to provide the materials and energy, now often in short supply, needed for expanding industries.

 About 200 leftist guerrillas blasted their way into the country's largest prison and battled guards, allowing about 10 inmates to escape and killing two prison workers, officials said. No guerrilla casualties were reported in half-hour battle Friday. The rebels entered the <LOCATION> Mariona </LOCATION> penitentiary, just north of the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, by blowing a hole in its wall, Gen. <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Golcher </PERSON>, deputy security minister, told reporters. The facility normally holds 1,000 inmates. Seven guards were wounded by rifle fire and grenade shrapnel and `` some prisoners'' also were injured, <PERSON> Golcher </PERSON> said, adding that 10 inmates escaped as the guerrillas withdrew. A guard interviewed by journalists as he left the prison said two civilian employees were killed. Some inmates set fires as the rebels launched their attack in the early afternoon, according to the guard. He said `` about 200'' guerrillas launched the assault. <PERSON> Golcher </PERSON> said a large number managed to get into the prison grounds during the `` very strong'' attack. A first-aid worker said three civilian employees suffered serious bullet wounds and were taken by ambulances to hospitals. Journalists were kept hundreds of yards away from the penitentiary as scores of soldiers were rushed to the prison. Two helicopters flew over the compound. Officials did not give a breakdown on the number of common criminals and the number of rebels held in <LOCATION> Mariona </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed government since 1979.

<HEAD>Killer Volcano Rumbles Back To Life, Hundreds Evacuated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BOGOTA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> _ Two and a half years after killing 23,000 people, a volcano rumbled back to life, sending ash miles upward, spewing fresh lava and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of farmers from surrounding hillsides. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> del Ruiz volcano's activity had stabilized by Friday night and there appeared to be little immediate danger of a major eruption, said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Volcano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manizales </LOCATION>. `` The evacuations are for avoiding any ugly surprises,'' he said in a communique. Airline pilots reported seeing steam and ash rising to 28,000 feet above the volcano, the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. About 1,900 people in the villages of <LOCATION> Libano </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestina </LOCATION>, all on the volcano's western slope, were being moved out Friday night, the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique. Before dark Friday, about 600 people living on farms on the sides of the volanco were evacuated, the emergency committee said. The <ORGANIZATION> Volcano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> upgraded its alert at nightfall Friday, advising people living along rivers up to 20 miles away to be ready to flee if the volcano erupts. An estimated 50,000 people live within a 15-mile radius of the volcano in what is considered the danger zone if there is a major eruption. The <ORGANIZATION> Andes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said it was recording almost constant tremors, but none strong enough to register on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The river danger zones were established by a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after the devastating Nov. 13, 1985 eruption. They includes the rivers <PERSON> Guali </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lagunilla </LOCATION>, Azufrado, <PERSON> Recio </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sabandija </LOCATION> to the east of the volcano and the <LOCATION> Chinchinica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the west. Residents of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, 20 miles northeast of the volcano and at the confluence of the <LOCATION> Guali </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Magdalena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, suspended their annual fishing festival. The dancing, parades, parties and heavy drinking mark the movement of millions of fish up rivers to spawn, a boon to fishermen. Sight of the awesome column of steam and ash sobered up many revelers, the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio network said. About a quarter-inch of ash covered the town of <LOCATION> Manizales </LOCATION> about 20 miles to the northwest of the volcano, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Manizales </LOCATION> is not considered to be in danger because it is outside the flooding zones. Friday's volcanic activity was the highest since the 1985 eruption, when melting glaciers on the volcano created flooding that left trees, boulders and other debris blocking the <LOCATION> Lagunilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on the western slope. The blockage burst, and a 10-story-high wall of mud roared down the river canyon, burst onto a plain and wiped out the town of <LOCATION> Armero </LOCATION> in seconds.

<HEAD>Eisenhower Seriously Considered Nuclear Strike Against China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> considered dropping nuclear bombs on Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 1950s to defend the Nationalist Chinese islands of <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION>, a historian says. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> `` actually brought the country to the ` nuclear brink,' far closer to war than a distraught public feared in 1955,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, citing declassified documents, made the comment in an article for the spring issue of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> University-based journal <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>. `` The possibility of using nuclear weapons was indeed considered,'' said a former senior counselor to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The president was definitely considering this alternative,'' the former official said Friday. `` The use that was discussed was of small nuclear weapons to be used against mainland airbases which were close enough to <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION> to provide air cover.'' The official said the tentative plan called for several atomic bombs of 10 to 15 kilotons each _ about the yield of the bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> _ to be dropped on the coastal air bases, whiche were in populated areas. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and key aides were aware that civilian casualties could number in the millions from such attacks, the official said. Consideration of a nuclear attack began little more than a year after <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> conditionally approved a plan in May 1953 to end the lingering Korean War with a full-scale military attack that might have included the use of atomic weapons against the Chinese. When the Chinese began shelling <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> in September 1954, acting Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> alerted <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> that the intensity of the attack on the Nationalist Chinese-held island seemed to herald an all-out assault. `` Over the next nine months, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in support of the Nationalists' defense of these islands, lurched toward disaster,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> wrote. But the Communist Chinese unexpectedly defused tensions. On April 23, 1955, Premier <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Enlai </PERSON> announced that his government was willing to negotiate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the reduction of tensions in the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said much of his article was based on material declassified in the last two or three years. He cited an excerpt that he said records the substance of a March 28, 1955, discussion between Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s policy planning staff. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> advanced the idea that we might serve notice that if the <ORGANIZATION> CHICOMs </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Chinese Communists -RRB- took <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION>, we would in future, from time to time, drop a bomb on them, in order to neutralize them and give the <ORGANIZATION> CHICOMs </ORGANIZATION> no advantage by their capture,'' the excerpt said. `` The secretary disagreed, saying that this would be a considerable waste of armament; and we would accomplish nothing but the killing of a number of harmless fishermen, whom the <ORGANIZATION> CHICOMS </ORGANIZATION> would put on the island in such an event,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 Deliberations in the `` preppie murder'' trial stalled because the jury could not agree on <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s state of mind at the time of the killing, a juror says Chambers, who could have been convicted of second-degree murder, pleaded guilty Friday to first-degree manslaughter in the Aug. 26, 1986 death of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, bringing those deliberations to a halt on their ninth day. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said the prospect of a possible mistrial, the strain on the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family and circumstantial evidence prompted him to agree to the plea bargain. `` There was one critical issue that kept swaying people back and forth. That issue was understanding the concept of operation of the mind,'' juror <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ognibene </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> entered his plea. `` We had the facts, we'd put it all together. The only thing lacking was what was going on in his mind at the time,'' <PERSON> Ognibene </PERSON> said. Jury forewoman <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanaugh </PERSON> said the panel was frustrated by the amount of circumstantial evidence. `` Both sides proved their points. Both sides' stories could be true,'' she said. <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON> said three jurors sent notes to the judge saying they could not go on. A prosecution source who spoke on condition of anonymity said a black juror `` thought a couple of the other jurors were racists,'' a woman juror was concerned because she had been scheduled to begin a new job on March 1 and the third `` just wanted out.'' The jury's vote swung from 8-4 for acquittal to 9-3 for conviction and ended up 7-5 for acquittal on the second-degree murder charge, <PERSON> Ognibene </PERSON> said. `` This was the most incredible experience of my life and I am satisfied the jury system works,'' he told reporters who mobbed him as he left the courthouse.

<TEXT>
 Despite some misgivings, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state senators have approved a measure allowing blind people to hunt deer and other game if accompanied by a sighted hunter. `` Do we really want people out there shooting guns when they do n't know where they're shooting?'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasee </PERSON> asked during debate Friday night. `` As much as I have empathy for the visually handicapped, I do n't believe I can support this.'' Sen. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> supported the proposal and noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> can issue licenses to handicapped hunters. People confined to wheelchairs are allowed to shoot or hunt from an automobile parked off a highway and more than 50 feet from the center of a roadway, he said. The bill extends eligibility for a special permit to people who present medical evidence that they are unable to hunt alone because of a permanent physical disability or handicap, including blindness. Under the measure, a visually handicapped hunter would have to be accompanied by someone who could assist in sighting the firearm. A 27-6 vote sent the measure to Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>.

 Part of a rocket launched by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to resupply its manned space station re-entered the atmosphere over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, lighting up the sky with celestial fireworks seen in three states, officials said. The rocket burned up on re-entry around 10:50 p.m. Friday, blazing its way across the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sky from southwest to northeast in a light show visible for more than a minute in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Radio stations, police and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> said they were besieged by calls from curious skywatchers. `` I saw a meteorite once that was pretty spectacular, but this one just blew that away. This was the most amazing celestial event I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>, 33, of Round Rock, who watched from his front yard. Although the rocket was bigger than a railroad boxcar, it was unlikely that it caused any damage on the ground, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, or NORAD, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said the rocket was used to launch a cargo satellite carrying food and other supplies to the Mir space station manned by two cosmonauts The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> launched the Progress 35 satellite Thursday, according to a report by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> had been tracking the rocket since its launch and had expected the re-entry, but had not known when or where. The reference book `` Soviet Military Power'' lists the SL-4 as the type of rocket normally used by Soviets to launch such a payload, <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said. The SL-4 weighs about 720,000 pounds and is about 91 feet long, <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said, citing the March 1988 issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology. `` When an object like that re-enters, it breaks up in the atmosphere, and you have these smaller pieces and sometimes you have quite a show,'' <PERSON> Pinnell </PERSON> said. He said he did n't know if the supplies had made it to the space station, were on their way, or burned up on re-entry. `` I would have to refer you to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>,'' the spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the Progress 35 cargo spacecraft carrying food, fuel, mail and equipment docked with the Mir space station today. There was no mention of the rocket re-entry. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecke </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist who operates a weather station from his home in <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, said the object looked like a meteorite to him. `` It was closer and larger than anything I've ever seen anything before, and I've been real active watching the skies since 1963,'' <PERSON> Hecke </PERSON> said. Motorists on Interstate 35 south of <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> pulled over to the side of the highway to watch the fireworks, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribble </PERSON>, a newsman for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ribble </PERSON> said it looked like the sparks caused by a car dragging a loose muffler on the road. `` It just kept growing, like a sparkler,'' said <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>, a 33-year-old technical writer for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` It went across the entire sky,'' he said. `` It took from 45 to 75 seconds. It gave me enough time to yell to the kids, and they saw it, too.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may continue to import its tiny Samurai sport-utility vehicle as a truck rather than a car because it enters the country without back seats, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has ruled. `` I do n't like making any decision which seems illogical. This decision does n't make any sense when people see how these vehicles are being used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but in this case the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` These are ` trucks' under the law when they enter this country,'' he said in announcing the decision Friday. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s Samurais are imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as trucks because <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> does n't have a large enough allocation under the Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship them as cars or sport-utility vehicles. Instead of paying a 2.5 percent car tariff, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> pays a 25 percent truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped without back seats to qualify as trucks. Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at dealerships. Few of the small, Jeep-like vehicles are sold without rear seats. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> sold 81,349 Samurais in this country in 1987 and said it plans to sell 100,000 this year. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>'s decision `` It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the Japanese are shipping seats into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> separately, then installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the -LRB- voluntary export restraints -RRB-,'' he said. Last year, Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had little interest in helping the Japanese government enforce its export limits, particularly since federal government takes in more money when a maker opts to pay the 25 percent tariff instead of the lower fee.

 Riot police backed by water cannons beat and arrested hundreds of Roman Catholics in western <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> who staged a rare demonstration for religious freedom, Western reporters said today. About 2,000 people in the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> gathered Friday night in front of the National Theater for a candlelight rally banned by Communist authorities, who tightly control religious activities. Witnesses said authorities broke up the demonstration by pushing into side streets protesters who had been singing Slovak and Czech national anthems, praying and holding candles. Hundreds of people were arrested and many were beaten by police, including some journalists, reporters said. There is growing discontent among Catholics at authorities' refusal to agree to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> candidates to fill 10 vacant bishoprics No new Czechoslovak bishops have been named since 1973 and the three alive are all over 75. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernogursky </PERSON>, who helped organize the rally, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> that if there were similar protests in future, `` then the government will no longer be able to freely decide over the heads of the citizens.'' `` It was a new form of civil protest in this country after 40 years, because a previously announced demonstration of citizens.. has practically never taken place here before,'' he told Austrian radio. The massive police turnout and violent action to disperse the crowd appeared designed to discourage opposition by Catholics, 430,000 of whom are said to have so far signed a petition for religious freedom and the appointment of bishops and priests. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoermann </PERSON> of Austrian state television <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION> said his crew was dragged away by policemen, who appeared drunk, and taken to police headquarters for 2 -LCB- hours. Two other <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION> journalists were held for eight hours. A team of the West German <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> network also was detained. <PERSON> Hoermann </PERSON> said he saw scores of people, drenched by water cannon, lined up at police headquarters with their faces to the wall. The exact number of arrests could not be determined. <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> is near the Austrian border, 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Negotiations between the government and a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in January were inconclusive, largely because the Holy See refused to agree to candidates belonging to the pro-government Pacem in <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION> organization of clergymen, which is banned by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The talks are scheduled to resume in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> next month. The 31-point petition being signed by hundreds of thousands of Catholics nationwide _ an unprecedented manifestation of Catholicism in the Soviet bloc _ has made authorities increasingly nervous. It calls for more bishops, more priests and separation of church and state as well as the right to question Marxist dogma and to petition authorities without harassment. The petition's author, <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navratil </PERSON>, was arrested earlier this month and charged with committing `` slander of a state organ and of a public organization,'' which carries a term of up to one year imprisonment. <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklosko </PERSON>, a Slovak Catholic activist, had announced the rally to authorities `` on behalf of several faithful fellow citizens'' and organizers expected up to 70,000 participants. But authorities on Thursday issued a ban, saying the planned demonstration was `` an event guided from abroad'' that was directed against the socialist system.

 <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> was like `` a dead city'' today as residents pressing for annexation of a disputed region of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> stayed home to protest a crackdown on activism, dissidents reported. Soldiers and police with attack dogs were the only people on the streets while army helicopters hovered over the city of 1.4 million, said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON>, of the dissident journal Glasnost, quoting sources there. Thousands of Azerbaijani police in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, capital of the disputed Nagorno-Karabahk region, kept a tight hold on the city and Armenian residents there also stayed home in protest, <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON> said, quoting sources in that city. Armenians account for more than three quarters of the 160,000 residents of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Four vocal leaders of the annexation campaign were arrested in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Friday after police ordered the dissolution of a committee organizing the quest for Armenian control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a Christian rights activist, said they were told by contacts in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that Armenians had decided to protest a clampdown on public demonstrations by refusing to go out of their apartments for the weekend. They said the silent protest was being adhered to by virtually the entire city. `` There are no children outside, no cars on the street, no activity whatsoever except for the troops occupying the city,'' <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> is like a dead city.'' He said activists told him 60,000 soldiers were patrolling the city. Mass demonstrations staged in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> in late February triggered rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, where at least 32 were killed, 197 injured and 400 arrested for murder, rape, robbery and other crimes. Authorities had threatened criminal action against those taking part in any future illegal protests to press for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian region that has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. Armenians are predominantly Christian while most Azeris are Moslem. Those arrested Friday in the southern republic were identified as Paruyr Arikyan, <PERSON> Mofses </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirzoyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mekhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabrielyan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON>. All four arrested had been pressing the annexation cause and providing information to foreign journalists. Soviet authorities have forbidden foreign correspondents to travel to the region. Telephone contact has also been disrupted. Numerous attempts to telephone <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> today were unsuccessful. Even calls to police stations and news offices went unanswered. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> said he was arrested and sent back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after arriving in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Friday night on an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flight, and <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON> said Glasnost magazine's office was broken into overnight and ransacked in what might have been an official effort to discourage continued involvement in the dispute. Glasnost editor <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> is Armenian and has been serving as an information liaison with Western news organizations. Meanwhile, a national newspaper today accused the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership of trying to suppress the sensitive ethnic dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the `` organs of power'' should instead have openly discussed the proposal with Armenians. The critical commentary in the party youth newspaper contrasted sharply with articles Friday in two official newspapers, Pravda and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, that accused annexation activists of resorting to pressure tactics. Trud, the labor newspaper, criticized the state-run press today for failing to accurately report the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> issue out of fear that it would stir up passions among the more than 100 Soviet nationalities. The Armenian government on Friday ordered the disbanding of an organizing committee spearheading the annexation drive, and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported that self-appointed groups of activists, intellectuals and republic political leaders were `` disbanding themselves.'' Morning broadcasts of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> carried no news from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Another round of strikes and demonstrations had been called in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today, when the unofficial organizing committee was to meet. But activists called off the protests to avoid confrontation with security forces. The Communist leadership has taken a hard line against the annexation campaign and public activism, though at the same time attempting to appease Armenians who fear <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is losing its traditional ethnic character. The Politburo has ordered a major improvement in living conditions in the region, including steady reception of Armenian-language television programming and more Armenian literature.

 Five school children believed exposed to a rabid bat are getting shots to prevent them from getting rabies, and officials say more children may need treatment. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Alvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they have advised parents of at least 31 children who may have been exposed to contact physicians to determine if treatment is necessary, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, assistant principal. `` I would guess we would have six to eight children get the shots before this is over,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, chief of the county's Division of Communicable Disease Control. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said three boys found the bat Tuesday while playing near an apartment complex in this town about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. They put it in a box and brought it to school for `` show and tell'' the next day, where many fifth - and sixth-graders either saw or touched the bat, he said It is not believed that the bat bit any children, but the animal was salivating and the saliva carries the deadly virus. The bat was determined to be rabid after a parent at the apartment complex saw one of the boys with the animal, confiscated it and contacted health authorities.

 Two men have been charged with murdering two British soldiers during a funeral for an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member in which the soldiers were beaten, stripped and then shot execution-style. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, 28, both of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, were charged Friday night with the murders of army corporals <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, police said. <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> pleaded innocent today in court, but <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> entered no plea. Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON> ordered them held in custody until their next court appearance on April 22. The soldiers were killed March 19 after they drove up to the funeral procession of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Mourners dragged them from their car and beat them unconscious. They were later shot behind a wall in a soccer stadium. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for killing the soldiers, both members of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signals </ORGANIZATION>, in the staunchly <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andersonstown </LOCATION> district of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> smiled and nodded to relatives in the small courtroom during the hour-long proceeding. The detective in charge of the murder investigation told the court that bloodstained fragments of glass were found on the clothing of the two accused. `` There was also bloodstaining found on the trousers worn by the accused -LRB- <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> -RRB- when he was arrested and which have been identified as being consistent with the blood of Cpl. <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>,'' the detective said. `` An examination of the jacket belonging to <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> contained fibers consistent with fibers belonging to a sweater identified as Cpl. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s.'' The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, does not release the names of its investigating officers for security reasons. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the accused men were arrested in a black taxi in the <LOCATION> Andersonstown </LOCATION> area shortly after the killings. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was one of three people who died when a Protestant gunman opened fire and hurled grenades at the March 16 funeral of three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas slain March 6 by British commandos in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. Authorities said the guerrillas were planning a bomb attack. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Testimony in the <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> trial will be halted so a judge can investigate whether prosecutors should be sanctioned for withholding evidence from the defense. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> made the announcement Friday after Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> conceded materials he recently surrendered to defense lawyers should have been turned over before the trial began in December. The material concerns a former LaRouche consultant the defense contends was used by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to entrap the political extremist, six aides and five <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> groups. They are charged with plotting to obstruct a grand jury investigation of alleged credit card and loan fraud during <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said he also would hold hearings next week to determine whether other documents given to the defense lawyers this month should have been surrendered earlier. Those documents discuss alleged <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> infiltration of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> groups and include a memo between two pivotal figures in the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said the jury would be called into court briefly Monday so <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> could finish questioning a former <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aide about the organization's hierarchy and fund raising. Then <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> will hold a hearing focusing on <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quade </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant who also worked as a consultant to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> was listed as a prosecution witness until earlier this month, about the same time the defense received copies of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents indicating a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> agent sought <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>'s help with the LaRouche investigation. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s headquarters is in <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> played a minimal role in the investigation, but the defense claims the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had him make erroneous statements to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aides about the case Included in the hundreds of notebooks seized by investigators are several passages quoting <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, including one in which he said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> had been successful in blocking the grand jury investigation. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said the comment was evidence of a conspiracy to obstruct the investigation. The prosecutor and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who sought <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>'s help deny that <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> was told to make the statement. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, in an affidavit, said he had lied to the LaRouche groups throughout his association with them. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> lawyers also learned this week that <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> recorded an interview he had with a private investigator hired by a defense lawyer, and that he played the tape for <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> and another prosecutor. During the interview, conducted prior to the trial, the investigator discussed defense strategy. At Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> and several <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents are scheduled to testify about his dealings with the agency. Possible sanctions <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> can impose range from a continuance to allow further defense preparation to dismissal of the case. Then, provided the case is not dismissed, <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> is to hold hearings to determine whether <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> should have surrendered to the defense prior to trial memos discussing possible <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> infiltration of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> groups. Among those is a memo in which retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> told then-White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> that an associate had `` collected info against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has begun a high-level investigation of a train collision in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> that killed 28 people, including 27 Japanese, official reports said today. A preliminary investigation found that brake failure caused the two trains to crash head-on Thursday, but it was not known why they failed, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatao </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Foreign Affairs office said. Ninety-nine people were injured in the crash, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fourth fatal train wreck this year. The collision occurred when a train heading south to scenic <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> slammed into a northbound train from <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>. The Hangzhou-bound train was carrying 193 Japanese high school students and teachers on a tour of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and nearby cities. In all 169 people died in the four accidents. Another 108 people died in a plane crash in January. Senior leaders responded to the string of accidents with demands for greater attention to safety, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s railway minister resigned earlier this month in disgrace to take responsibility for several train disasters. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> appointed Deputy Railway Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Senmao </PERSON>, Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qizhen </PERSON> and two <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> vice mayors to head the group investigating the latest crash. `` This shows that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> attaches great importance to the work of improving transportation safety,'' said Fu. State Council General Secretary <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Junsheng </PERSON>, representing acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> today visiting the injured Japanese students and meeting with Japanese officials, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said. The nationally televised evening news broadcast lengthy footage of Chinese officials and weeping Japanese relatives bearing flowers and food visiting the 24 students who remained hospitalized. Relatives of the Japanese victims flew to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> by a charter plane Friday, and visited the site of the crash Saturday, where they laid flowers in honor of the dead. Three Japanese doctors arrived on Saturday to help treat the injured. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said two Japanese students remained in critical condition. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said the bodies of the 26 students and one teacher will be sent home by charter plane Sunday. However, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said three of the dead will be cremated in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> at the request of the family. The news broadcast said train service was restored on the line this afternoon.

<TEXT>
 Scorching Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> temperatures sparked beach brawls among gang members and contributed to this year's first round of brushfires, authorities say, but some relief is on the way. Sunny but slightly cooler weather is forecast Sunday, but with hot <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds in the evening and Monday. The mercury climbed to the 90s throughout the area Friday and hit 100 degrees in Thermal and <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, setting new records for the second day in a row as tens of thousands sought escape at the beaches. At the downtown Civic Center, a sizzling 96 degrees shattered the previous high for the day of 89, set in 1978. Thursday's high of 94 topped the previous mark of 89, set in 1930. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sweltered in record-breaking 89-degree heat, which topped the previous record of 86 degrees on March 25, 1947. `` It's so hot my shoes are melting on the pavement,'' complained <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> during a mid-day walk in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Postcard-clear skies teamed up with the heat and a medium surf to draw 250,000 people to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> beaches, lifeguards reported. But at <LOCATION> Zuma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> the scene was far from idyllic. An estimated 100 to 200 members of two rival street gangs broke car windows and started two brawls. Two 16-year-olds were taken to a hospital with bruises and head injuries and four people were arrested, sheriff's deputies said The high temperatures combined with hot <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds launched the unofficial start of fire season as two different blazes burned nearly 200 acres Friday. In northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, firefighters were still mopping up today after a 100-acre fire in rugged terrain that investigators believe was caused by a spark from state <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> equipment. One firefighter was treated and released for a minor injury. In <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, a discarded cigarette was believed to have caused a fire which burned about 80 acres of a rocky hillside on the city's northeast edge, city fire Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coryell </PERSON> said today. Many of those who could n't enjoy the day at the beach turned on their air conditioners. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> reported a 3 p.m. peak power use of 12,292 megawatts, about 1,500 megawatts above normal and a record for the date. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says some relief is due Sunday as the high-pressure system causing the heat spell moves eastward, allowing an increased marine influence. Temperatures Sunday will hit the low to mid-70s in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, slightly above normal for this time of year, and the mid-70s in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, about normal. Highs in the desert areas will rise to the 80s to low 90s. Skies will remain clear except for some patchy clouds along the coast during morning hours, and more <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds are due in the area Sunday night and Monday.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> photographer went on trial today for smuggling cocaine, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agent testified that a drug ring tricked the photographer into transporting their cocaine. <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a 23-year-old freelance photographer from <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is charged with smuggling more than four pounds of cocaine into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in a false-bottomed suitcase on March 13, 1987. The prosecution is asking for 10 years in prison on charges of contraband and violating public health laws that prohibit the transport or sale of dangerous drugs. The defense contends that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> did n't know the cocaine was in the suitcase. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> has spent the past year in pre-trial detention in <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s 85-year-old Model Prison without possibility of bail. He told the court he had carried a suitcase to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, while on assignment to take travel brochure photographs for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, an Ecuador-born, naturalized American living near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> on Feb. 5 pleaded guilty to a one-count charge of conspiracy to smuggle drugs in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. He received a two-year suspended sentence after he provided information that led to the indictment of three Spaniards and three Bolivians in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal drugs. They remain at large. <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> told an American court he had shared a hotel room with <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and planted the cocaine-lined suitcase on <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he thought the suitcase contained only travel brochures and film and said <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> had represented himself as one of the owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Sorosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Special Agent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> testified for the defense that he became interested in the <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> case while assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> area, and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> was investigating a cocaine-smuggling ring the agency believed operated out of northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I have found that there is a group of people involved in sending drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> using unsuspecting people as carriers,'' <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON> also testified he came to the conclusion <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was `` innocent _ or stupid _ but innocent.'' Assistant U.S. District Attorney <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified for the defense that testimony obtained from <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> following a plea-bargain arrangement with his attorney indicated <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had unwittingly taken the cocaine-laden suitcase to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> -RRB- specifically told us that <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had no knowledge that there was cocaine in the suitcase he carried into <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> airport March 13,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. There are no jury trials in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Presencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> said at the close of the 2 -LCB- - hour trial he would deliver his verdict later <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> wore a gray suit and stood with his hands clasped behind his back when addressing the court. He spoke in Spanish with occasional assistance from a court-appointed interpreter. His parents <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, sat directly behind him. His 25-year-old brother, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON>, also was present. Prosecutor <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> called only two witnesses _ the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on duty at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> who discovered the cocaine _ and the chemist who analyzed the drug as being 84-percent pure cocaine. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Campa </PERSON> said the prosecution had not proven <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> knew there was cocaine in the suitcase and said the defendant had never denied taking the luggage from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> told the court he had always obeyed the laws of the country in which he was and said he could have been `` stupid _ but that is not a crime.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Saturday ordered an investigation into allegations by an anti-nuclear activist who said he was tortured at headquarters of her security force and his companion murdered. Presidential Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, which will carry out the inquiry, to ensure the safety of the activist. The bureau is a civilian agency. <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 18, was recovering in a hospital. He suffered a deep cut in the back of the neck which doctors said may have been inflicted with a machete or ax. The injury was similar to that which killed his companion, <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> told reporters on Friday that he, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> and five other members of the leftist organization Youth for Democracy and Nationalism were attacked March 19 while putting up posters condemning nuclear arms and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> were chased by a gang of armed men who were wearing civilian clothes but identified themselves as police. He said the men caught him and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> and took them to a military compound behind the presidential palace, where they tortured the two and accused them of belonging to the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The compound houses the president's security forces. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said they were beaten with iron rods and burned with cigarettes as they were kept blindfolded and handcuffed. He said three men loaded them into a car Monday night and took them to a field on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, where they were hacked in the back of the neck. Col. <PERSON> Voltaire </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazmin </PERSON>, commander of the presidential security group, has denied his unit was involved. He added in a separate statement that his unit was investigating <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>'s allegations. But in his statement, <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Gazmin </PERSON> and the Manila-area command of the Philippine Constabulary to drop any investigations and leave the matter entirely to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based human rights group, charged that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military was using torture and murder to fight a 19-year-old communist insurgency.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired two long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its fighter-bombers pounded Iraqi troops in a battle for a strategic region in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missile strike ended a two-day lull in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s bombardment of the Iranian capital during a month-long exchange known as the `` war of the cities. Missiles fired by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have killed hundreds of civilians during the latest outbreak. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying: `` The only reply we have to those who refuse peace and attack our cities and borders is death and destruction. We are going to ... level their cities.'' <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. There was no report from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> about where the missiles exploded. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes bombed residential sections of the western city of <LOCATION> Ilam </LOCATION> today. There was no immediate word of casualties. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said at least 53 civilians were killed and 112 wounded in Iraqi air raids on <LOCATION> Borujerd </LOCATION> and other western Iranian towns Friday. Fighting in a key Iranian offensive in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also was fierce. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today Iranian fighter-bombers attacked troops there as Iranian Revolutionary Guards were reported thrusting into the <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains in the 11-day-old offensive. The strategic area lies east of the <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oilfiends, which produce about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, more than half of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s current daily output. The Iranians claim they have killed or wounded 11,500 Iraqis, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200 tanks and armored vehicles since they launched the offensive March 16. Iranian communiques said their forces advanced 10 miles into northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped chemical bombs on three towns overrun by the invaders, killing 5,000 Kurdish civilians and injured 5,000 more. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has said it will send a team of experts to investigate the reported Iraqi use of chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. On another front, the Iranian news agency said other Iranian warplanes heavily bombarded <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troop concentrations and defense lines around the strategic southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> today. It was the third straight day the Iranians have hit that sector. An estimated 250,000 Revolutionary Guards and volunteer fighters have amassed east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in past weeks for a long-expected offensive. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said two French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1s were downed by Iranian interceptors Friday over the northern gulf while two Soviet-built Sukhoi-22 fighter-bombers raiding the Iranian city of <LOCATION> Borujerd </LOCATION> also were shot down by anti-aircraft missiles. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said only one of its jets was lost Friday in 343 combat missions, the highest one-day total in a year. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also claimed Friday to have shot down four U.S.-built F-5 jets in the northeastern fighting, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied the claim. The Iranian claims raised to eight the number of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets reported shot down in dogfights or by ground fire Friday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamanei </PERSON> declared late Friday that he will send an envoy to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for talks with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war But it quoted him as saying he held out little hope of an agreement. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has also said it's ready to engage in the indirect discussions.

 The political invectives exchanged between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for decades can barely be heard over a new chorus: `` Let's do business together.'' Merchants are scrambling to trade across the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> presses ahead with its modernization program and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> eases its no-contact policy with the Communist mainland. The development could profoundly influence future political relations between the countries, some political experts say. `` How can you help but find that relations will just keep on rolling after this?'' said <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Weng </PERSON>, a political analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION>. `` To be able to do business ... necessarily leads to -LRB- political -RRB- cooperation.'' Taiwanese officials say direct trade will remain outlawed for the present. But signs of increased business ties, made through legal and illegal channels, are apparent in both countries. Taiwanese markets openly display Chinese medicinal herbs, ginseng, dates, walnuts and other foodstuffs from the mainland. Mouthwatering mainland specialties _ dried duck from <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, salted fish from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and whole hams from <LOCATION> Jinhua </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province _ also are available in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, factory tours often reveal a Taiwanese connection. The state-of-the-art Haide Polyester Plant on <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> island uses polyester chips from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shenzhen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province boasts that money of an American-Taiwanese investor helped the firm gain favorable treatment from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. The signs of cooperation arise against a backdrop of years of enmity. After losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland and fleeing to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949, the Nationalist government strictly prohibited Taiwanese from doing business with the Communists. Anyone caught doing so was considered a traitor. But the Nationalists, while continuing to reject official contact with the mainland, recently eased restrictions on people-to-people ties. They also gave a boost last year to now flourishing indirect trade by allowing imports of several mainland food items through third countries. Much of the business comes through the British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on the southeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> coast, where last year indirect trade between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> totaled $ 1.5 billion, up 58 percent from 1986. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s exports accounted for $ 1.2 billion of the trade and consisted primarily of textiles, machinery and electrical appliances, according to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government trade statistics. A group of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese merchants with ties to the Nationalist government recently opened the <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to facilitate trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About 150 Taiwanese companies display exhibits there to entice mainland Chinese companies to buy everything from machine tools to cosmetics. `` In the future, we will open the market in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said center representative <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwai </PERSON>, `` so I think this is the bridge.'' The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> recently reported an increasing number of companies have invested or plan to invest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in textiles, footwear, fertilizers, chemicals and food processing. Such activity would have to be carried out through third countries. A Chinese official this month disclosed plans to set up in southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province a product-processing zone for Taiwanese companies that would receive preferential treatment. <PERSON> Weng </PERSON>, the political analyst, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might use such contacts with Taiwanese businesses as a way to reach `` people who are not in the political field.'' Political leaders have been deadlocked for 40 years, with each group claiming to be legitimate rulers over the mainland. Each country says it is committed to reunification _ but under its own terms. Despite the increasing trade, Taiwanese officials are still balking at too much contact too soon with the mainland. `` Too much direct trade will have a negative impact on our efforts to restructure our industries,'' said Taiwanese Premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-kwa </PERSON> recently. `` We want our companies to produce more sophisticated products, but the mainland market is only a market for low-end consumer goods.'' Some <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> merchants, however, argue that profits from selling low-end goods to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can be used to acquire advanced technology and equipment from the West.

<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has lifted a freeze on the city's bank accounts that had threatened to cast the community into bankruptcy, it was reported Saturday. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> said a compromise has been reached between the city and the lawyer for a family seeking payment of $ 4 million jury award, permitting the lifting of the freeze. The lawyer, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, and city spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> would not comment on the report. However, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> said the bank received a copy of the judge's order releasing the accounts, according to the newspaper. It did not identify the spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrivner </PERSON> imposed the freeze Wednesday in response to a motion filed by <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> suffered permanent brain damage in 1984 after being beaten by a cellmate at the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> jail. He was awarded $ 4 million, and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the city of 55,000 residents to pay the settlement. <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> successfully petitioned <ORGANIZATION> Scrivner </ORGANIZATION> to freeze the bank accounts to force the city to comply with the order. The latest action will allow at least $ 85,000 in outstanding checks to be cashed and probably came in time to enable the city to meet next week's payroll for its 300 employees, Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported that the agreement calls for payments to DeBow of $ 25,000 Tuesday and a further $ 54,000 by May 17 to bring interest on the settlement current. The newspaper said the agreement also calls for monthly payments of $ 20,000 to meet interest of 6 percent while setting up a payment plan, and a restructuring of the city's utility tax bonds to pay off the award.

<TEXT>
 Rewriting his own rules for superpower summitry, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is preparing to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that appear unlikely to produce a new arms treaty or resolve major disputes. With the end of his presidency fast approaching, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has decided to ignore his requirement that a summit must hold the promise of success and must lead to the signing of a substantial agreement. `` The man is 77 years old, and I think he wants to come out in the history books as somebody who has done tremendous things in superpower relations for the long-term benefit of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, vice president for political-military affairs at the Center for Strategic and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` I subscribe to the theory that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to make a strategic arms agreement a centerpiece of what he will have accomplished over eight years,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` I think it's possible he can do it before next January but I certainly do n't think it's going to happen at the May-June summit <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from May 29 to June 2, the first American president to go to the Soviet capital in 14 years. The president had cited his insistence on guaranteed success in refusing to meet with Soviet leaders <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>. He bent the rule to hold an introductory meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985. However, the rule was back in force in 1986 when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. With no advance prospects of agreement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> doggedly refused to call it a summit. For their third meeting _ the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December _ an agreement was ready for signing to abolish intermediate-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had refused to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until that treaty was completed. But in inviting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviet leader made no demand for the completion of an even more ambitious arms agreement, the strategic arms accord that would cut deeply into long-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> both appear content to meet, merely for the sake of meeting. Even with no agreements, there are sure to be political rewards for both leaders. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> both will get credit for continuing the superpower dialogue at the highest level and for struggling with the difficult problems of arms control, analysts say. For <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the summit will showcase his foreign policy achievements before a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference later in June. For <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, it will highlight efforts toward peacemaking as the presidential campaign moves toward the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions. `` It will give the perception of progress in dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which certainly will help <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' the expected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Both sides -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- get political benefit in showing progress is being made. It's hard to have a summit and not come up with something,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also will score points in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where polls show <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is perceived more of a peacemaker than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Yet it appears unlikely they will be able to sign a new arms accord. `` I would n't want to lay you odds,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, when asked if a treaty would be ready. Similarly, the superpowers have deep differences about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that were not resolved by three days of talks between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> last week. Putting a positive spin on the summit, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` It will be well prepared. There will be substance to discuss. There will be good prospects for success. There will be a number of important and substantive and meaningful issues to be resolved, and all of those will occur at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit.'' Asked how that would meet the old criteria of having a major agreement ready for signing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` It meets all the criteria that needs to be met.''

 A Palestinian man died today of wounds suffered in a clash with Israeli troops, the army said, and the mayor of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> heeded a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> call for Israeli-appointed mayors in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to resign. Arab reporters said troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> continued a pattern of overnight arrests in an apparent attempt to stifle demonstrations planned for Palestinian `` Land Day'' next Wednesday. The army had no comment on reports of arrests. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with two members of a group affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next week to push his initiative for peace. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> invited professors <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> to visit him at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli officials had reacted angrily to the meeting, saying it violated a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment not to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Said and <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had protested the meeting to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Ayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 21, of nearby <LOCATION> Zawata </LOCATION> village, died at 4 a.m. of gunshot wounds to his spinal cord and liver. The army confirmed the death. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military source as saying <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> was shot in a clash between soldiers and protesters who blocked the <LOCATION> Nablus-Tulkarm </LOCATION> highway with burning tires. Another Arab was wounded in the same clash, it said. Today's death brings to 112 the number of Palestinians killed since unrest erupted Dec. 8 in territories captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Protesters in several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> cities demanded the resignation of muncipal councils, answering the call of a clandestine <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflet that called today `` the day of struggle against municipal councils and appointed village councils.'' Municipal officials confirmed that the Israeli-appointed acting mayor of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hamza </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkmani </PERSON>, had offered his resignation and expected a reply later in the week. The officials insisted they not be identified by name for fear of angering either <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or Palestinian nationalists. Former <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shawwa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Turkmani </PERSON> was on loan to the municipality from his job in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, thus he has resigned from the municipality,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflet called for marches and demonstrations `` to rid us of these appointed councils, and the people of the uprising will be severe with anyone who remains outside national consensus and refuses to resign immediately.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters marched to the municipal council building demanding the resignation of council members, and troops responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw about 70 youths hurl rocks at soldiers and the municipality building on Manger Square. Troops responded with rubber bullets and warning shots in the air. An Arab reporter said troops used tear gas and rubber bullets in a clash with about 150 Arab youths who marched through the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> village of Beit Hanoun carrying banners demanding the village council resign. The reporter also said troops forced closure of shops along <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s central <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> el Mukhtar street, which was blocked with rocks and burning tires, and chased away street venders selling vegetables.

<HEAD>Pakistan Says Agreement Can Be Signed Once Aid Issue Settled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator at the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks said Saturday that an agreement could be clinched if the Soviets would agree with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to suspend all aid to the warring parties. Acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said that since another outstanding issue _ that of a transitional government _ appears to have been resolved in principle, `` we feel that as soon as the two guarantors resolve the issue of symmetry, the instruments can be signed.'' By `` symmetry,'' he was referring to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s position that it would be a guarantor of a settlement only if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stops military aid to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government at the same time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ceases military aid to the Moslem guerrillas fighting the government. The Soviets have rejected that demand as amounting to interference with relations between two sovereign states bound by international treaties. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is cutting off its supply of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to the Afghan resistance but is rushing at least $ 300 million in other weapons to them before an agreement is reached. The Post cited diplomatic and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, who were not identified. It said the decision to stop supplying Stingers apparently was reached late last month in anticipation of a peace settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Among the U.S.-purchased military equipment being rushed to the resistance are 120mm Spanish heavy mortars and modern mine-clearing weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, briefing reporters, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not prepared to stop or suspend aid to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` It seeks the unilateral right to continue to supply arms to the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' He said `` a Soviet willingness to assume equal and reciprocal obligations as a guarantor can clinch the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements and a political settlement of the Afghan problem.'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has told <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> `` that the texts of the four instruments -LRB- of an agreement -RRB- are now complete and that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does not seek any amendments or changes or modifications in the drafts.'' He noted that the issue of a transitional government appeared to have been resolved following last week's meeting between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has insisted during the talks that a broad-based transitional government would be needed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to ensure peace in the country following the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Red Army troops. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had balked, saying this was outside the scope of the peace talks. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had indicated support for having <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> act in a personal capacity to promote an intra-Afghan dialogue. In a related development, diplomatic sources said that <PERSON> Nicolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozyrev </PERSON>, the special Soviet envoy who has followed the talks from the wings since the latest round began March 2, met <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> Saturday to brief him on the Shultz-Shevardnadze talks. The U.N.-sponsored talks are due to resume Monday, following a weekend recess.

<HEAD>Administration Seems Confused On Afghan `End Game'</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was close to proposing a halt in covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance in exchange for an agreement by the Soviets to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rejected the idea, say current and former administration officials. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said after talks last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tougher line was the final obstacle to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> acceptance of a U.N.-brokered deal to get the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But he said the Soviets might pull out even without a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agreement. Last December, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said publicly that military assistance to the Afghan mujahedeen would continue until the Soviets were completely out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the administration already is ending the supply of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to the resistance in anticipation of a peace settlement. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, the administration is rushing at least $ 300 million worth of other U.S.-purchased military supplies, including 120mm Spanish heavy mortars, to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in an effort to get the weaponry there before any pact barring future aid takes effect. The newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, said the Stinger cutoff reflects a general nervousness by the administration about leaving a large number of the missiles in the hands of Afghan factions that can not be controlled after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties are cut. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> already has obtained some of the missiles, perhaps through force, from one guerrilla commander. The apparent confusion over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy results from what former and current <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and congressional officials say has been a poorly coordinated `` end game'' strategy for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` My phone rang one day, and it was someone asking what our policy was on cutting off aid to the mujahedeen,'' said a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` I said that our policy was to continue the aid until the Soviets were completely out. Then, I called over to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and found out they had other ideas.'' Later that same day, Dec. 3, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> forced the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to scramble when a reporter asked if aid to the guerrillas would cease when the Soviets began to withdraw. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think we could do anything of the kind, because the puppet government that has been left there has a military ... You ca n't suddenly disarm them and leave them prey to the other government.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> then formulated a new policy, still not as hard as the president's, telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid would end once the Soviet withdrawal began, but would be resumed if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continued to supply its client regime in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with wepons. `` We will continue our assistance to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance until it is no longer needed,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs on Feb. 25. And <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> denied assertions by two congressional backers of the Afghan resistance, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, D-Tex., that the department cut a secret deal with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to stop aid to the guerrillas `` There have been no secret deals.

He urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` make a thorough review of any commitments which may have been made without your full support or knowledge.''

<HEAD>Views of Crisis Differ From Potomac to Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In their tenth month of crisis, many Panamanians are adopting the American view that officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ca n't see beyond the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. As <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems have grown from bad to desperate, the word out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been that the days, even hours, of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are numbered. Panamanians are n't convinced. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulino </PERSON>, a leader in the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, says <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman shows no signs of throwing in the towel soon. As an anti-Noriega strike ended its first week Friday, <PERSON> Mulino </PERSON> rolled his eyes when asked by a reporter if the defense chief's ouster appeared close `` I do n't think so,'' he replied. `` I do n't know what it is going to take to get him out, but the strike will continue.'' The very different view of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was illustrated late last week by a visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman. `` When we were stateside, we were given a picture of a very short frame of reference,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We were told we were looking at a time frame of a very few days in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be expected to depart, cave in, what have you.'' That assessment came from <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who briefed <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa., before they left Thursday on their two day fact-finding trip for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Less than 24 hours later in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON> had a new frame of reference. `` The view we're getting here is quite different _ from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy, from the American military and from Panamanians we've talked with,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said `` Nobody's talking about hours, nobody's talking about days. And that's for sure.'' A few days earlier, a Panamanian woman pleaded for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help as she ran past an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter watching soldiers clear a street of demonstrators with tear gas and shotgun pellets. `` What's the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> waiting for?'' she yelled. `` Ca n't you see what's happening There are our soldiers. Where are yours?'' Many Panamanians want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do more in a bid to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s exit. Some speak openly of military intervention _ something President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has ruled out unless the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> is clearly threatened. Even the wife of <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> _ the president in hiding whose ouster by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month fueled <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s current crisis _ has suggested publicly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to send in troops as a last resort. But the canal appears safe for the moment, and American military intervention seems unlikely. `` I do n't think anybody _ even if their elevator does n't go all the way to the top floor _ would consider jeopardizing the canal,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. While <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been counting hours until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s anticipated departure, Panamanians have heard their clocks tick through an escalating series of constitutional and financial crises that have left their once prosperous country destitute, their banks and businesses closed and many people without cash or food <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been partly responsible for the fiscal crisis through its economic sanctions. But most of the crunch stems from years of unbridled spending by military-dominated governments that have held sway in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since 1968. They have given the country a $ 4.8 billion foreign debt, one of the highest per capita in the world. The country is in such bad shape that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is worried further economic sanctions could leave it a dead prospect for any future, democratic government. That's one reason <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has n't imposed a total trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, limiting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sanctions instead to a series of half measures, taken a step at a time `` It's a very delicate line we walk,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. `` Nobody wants to sink the ship in order to get at the captain. `` We have boxed ourselves in on this one. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is to a great extent a Frankenstein of our making, and the people of this country are counting on us to do something.''

<TEXT>
 Six Moslem fishermen were shot and killed off the eastern coast of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, and nine of their companions were missing and feared dead, a Sri Lankan military official said Saturday. The official said six bullet-riddled bodies washed ashore Saturday near the eastern port of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>. The men and nine others had set out a day earlier from the village of <LOCATION> Nilaweli </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> harbor, he said. <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> is 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The official said he had no information on who might have killed the fishermen. He briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. A Sri Lankan news agency blamed the attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the rebel groups that has been waging a nearly five-year war for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east of the island. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> quoted residents of the area as saying they heard the sounds of motor boats and gun shots off the coast Friday night. <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said several hundred angry fishermen surrounded the police station at the village of <LOCATION> Muttur </LOCATION> just south of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> to protest the slayings. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of the nation's 16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>. The Sinhalese, who comprise about 75 percent of the population, control the central government and the military. The rest of Sri Lankans are Moslem descendants of early Arab traders or Christian descendants of Western colonial settlers. Tamil militants have, in the past, attacked Moslems in the east to underscore their claim to the region. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> signed a peace accord with <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last July aimed at ending the Tamils' insurgency. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> have rejected the accord and have continued their guerrilla war. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has a large Tamil population in its south, has more than 50,000 troops on the island to try to enforce the peace pact. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-government newspaper, said the government has taken at least 300 Sinhalese into custody on suspicion they are members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front has pledged to kill anyone who supports the Indian-brokered peace accord, contending that it makes too many concessions to Tamils. The front has been blamed for killing at least 220 people and injuring 170 in the past five months. Another paper, the independent Sun, put the arrest total at around 650 in the past six months. Both quoted unnamed police sources.

<HEAD>Agreement Seems a Victory for Sandinistas, Defeat for Reagan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The cease-fire agreement signed this past week between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and the Contra rebels represents the most significant turning point for that country since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> first began backing the insurgents in 1981. Barring unexpected developments, the agreement will probably bring the war to an end and leave the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> with a firm grip on power. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since their 1979 revolution. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expended considerable political capital over the years attempting to convince his countrymen that Sandinista power, left unchecked, would mean a Soviet beachhead in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and grave national security risks for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was unable to muster consistent majority support for his policy. There were too many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who felt that the human costs of sustaining the war were too high when compared with the benefits <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saw in trying to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The price paid by Nicaraguans over the past seven years has been obvious. The war has claimed more than 40,000 lives and left the economy in a shambles. The policy never had much enthusiastic support beyond the conservative wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> it was difficult to find any president willing to express support for Contra aid, even in those <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said would be most affected by the collapse of the rebels. For all the energy <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent in support of the Contras, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved only about $ 209 million for them over seven years _ equivalent to what the administration says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> provides to the Sandinistas every few months. During the height of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> committed thousands of troops and spent that much every few days. Now, it appears there is little the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can do to influence events in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The administration has used extensive diplomatic and economic pressures to force the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' hand with minimal results and now it has been deprived of what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the Contras believe is their most effective lever _ military pressure. The best the Contras can hope for now is a humanitarian aid package the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will take up next week. Given its past statements, the administration may try to take advantage of the new mood of reconciliation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and explore ways to achieve a more normal relationship with the Sandinistas. There have been no serious talks between the two governments in more than three years. There are several theoretical scenarios under which what was done last week could be undone, and the war resumed. Under administration prodding, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could decide to commit itself next week to an early vote on additional Contra military aid if the peace process breaks down and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> makes an aid request. But it appears a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, worn down by the Contra aid issue, does not want to give the president that authority. The most likely outcome is a Contra surrender to terms set forth by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> during talks due to start on April 6 on a permanent truce. Under the agreement, the Contras will be allowed to take their arms with them to mutually agreed cease-fire zones. But their supplies are running low, there is little prospect for replenishment, and nothing prevents the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from surrounding these zones while talks on a permanent settlement are carried out. The Contras will be at a severe disadvantage. After a year in which the Contras had emerged as an effective fighting force, dispatching thousands of troops into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from sanctuaries in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, 1988 has marked a steady downward spiral. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defeated a key Contra aid vote on Feb. 3 and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decreed an end to all aid shipments on Feb. 29. The Contras agreed less than a month later to a cease-fire proposal that fell far short of their demands even though they won some concessions from the Sandinistas, including the promise of free speech and Contra participation in a national dialogue. The administration has praised the agreement but this is one instance in which there is a wide gap between the publicly stated view and the private assessment. Officials felt it was inappropriate to criticize the Contras for signing an agreement after a lack of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steadfastness forced their hand. `` The Contras made their own decision and they made it courageously, and we must not do anything to undo it,'' said White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' Saturday. `` We've got to wish them well, as indeed we do.'' Some of the most optimistic statements are being voiced by the Contra leaders themselves, including <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, who is among the most conservative of that group. `` Today we have taken a first but firm step to end this fratricidal war,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said Wednesday night after the agreement was signed. `` It is a very serious obligation that we are undertaking, the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as well as we in the resistance. I am certain that we will both comply.'' If <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> is right, then <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may be proved to have been wrong all along about the nature of the Sandinista government.

<TEXT>
 Newspapers and television are coming under increasing fire from governments across the world, which claim their coverage of violence and unrest only creates more of the same. In some cases, coverage has been limited. In others, it has been banned outright. A graphic television film of recent bloody rampages at two <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> funerals prompted strong complaints from the British government. That reaction was mild compared with other countries. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army regularly bars reporters and television crews from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, rocked by protests since Dec. 8. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, photographing or filming unrest and security force actions is prohibited in a state where anti-apartheid protests are common. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is closed to foreigners whenever an anti-Chinese protest occurs, and no Western reporter has been allowed to the troubled Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` There does seem to be a trend to keep the television cameras away,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Spender </PERSON>, deputy editor of the Index of Censorship, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> periodical that monitors media freedom worldwide. `` A very vivid picture says volumes, and it's very hard for a government to deny it's presiding over the mistreatment of people,'' Spender said in a recent interview. Some observers say in the long run, censorship wo n't work. `` If you look at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at the moment, the people who are being fooled by the turning off of the cameras are essentially the whites; certainly not the blacks,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a private human rights agency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The blacks know exactly what's happening. They either see it with their own eyes or they hear rumors, and rumors tend to exaggerate, and that builds new problems.'' Observers say many governments use the possibility of increased violence to mask their real concern: their image abroad. Other governments are more forthright. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, for example, has expelled or refused to admit foreign reporters and warned others it will not tolerate what it calls `` the continuation of disinformation'' that `` damages the image of our country abroad.'' Many Israelis are angry because television has documented Palestinian unrest and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attempts to crush it _ in particular, recent <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> shots of soldiers beating two unarmed Palestinians. Israeli President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> recently referred to news reports as a `` weapon'' being used against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I ask myself whether I'm permitted, in a very liberal and democratic approach, to allow this weapon to be turned against my children and my country,'' he said. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> have both suggested <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ban television crews from the occupied territories altogether. Before imposing stringent media controls, South African officials had complained that TV coverage encouraged unrest. But their main complaint was that the coverage gave a false or exaggerated impression of black dissent and encouraged sanctions and disinvestment moves. <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> and others acknowledged that news reports can stir up trouble. `` But I think you have to weigh the damage that's done by the opposite, by the clampdown,'' he said. Journalists should police themselves, he said. `` They have to be wary that they're not being used, or exploited, by either of the parties, whether it's the government or the objectors,'' he said. <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said that censorship is justified when lives are at stake `` because of a really volatile situation.'' `` But usually governments take the easier road of stepping in well before that point's arrived, and that's the damage -LRB- to freedom -RRB-,'' he said. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said it opposes any attempt to curb news gathering. `` Whether cameras can incite, I think there's no doubt that they do,'' its spokesman said. `` But the question is, which is the greater ill. You have to inform the public. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, few suggest the government should limit media coverage in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where nearly 2,700 people have died in almost 20 years of sectarian fighting. Indeed, public debate over the television footage of the bloody funeral has focused primarily on British police efforts to obtain untransmitted videotape to identify suspects. On Thursday, after threats of prosecution under anti-terrorist laws, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> networks </ORGANIZATION> gave police untransmitted videotape of an Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> funeral procession that ended with the slayings of two British soldiers. The networks had initially refused to hand over the tape on grounds it would endanger the lives of their crews working in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. To Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, it was a much simpler issue, as she outlined it to the House of Commons. `` Either one is on the side of justice in this matter, or on the side of terrorism,'' she said.

 As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> amazed the pundits with a political resurrection, the Democrats lost a front-runner off the good ship Monkey Business, staged what looked like candidate-a-week auditions for a replacement and now worry about a convention without a clear winner. At its midpoint, the 1988 presidential campaign can claim more than its share of unexpected twists and turns. Without a front-runner, the lesser known Democrats found it hard to get attention and gain stature. The race became `` a series of isolated judgments,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, campaign manager for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> referred to the phenomenon of no Democratic being able to put together a series of victories. And as both parties looked ahead to November, they expressed pessimism. `` This looks to me like 1960 all over again,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a conservative Republican and adviser to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. That was a year the Democrats recaptured the White House at the close of Republican <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s second term. Once again, said <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, `` You have an aging president, who's kind of loved and recognized as doing a decent job. `` This is the Democrats' year,'' he lamented. `` The Republicans are going to have to work real hard to change that and the Democrats are going to have to help them a little in this nomination process, which I think they're going to do.'' Some Democrats agree that they could easily give the Republican the help they need. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> predicted there'll be some brokering before the party's nominee can be selected, and he warned that if it takes place at the Democratic National Convention next summer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> `` the whole <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will see you in the grubby business of cutting deals.'' Two Democrats _ <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> _ were knocked out of contention long before any votes were cast. Television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> startled Republicans with his organizational skill, and even more with his accounts of conversations with God. Southern Democrats tried to give their nominating process a conservative cast and created Super Tuesday which gave the biggest boost to a pair of liberals _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s reputation took a beating and so did momentum. Voters demonstrated repeatedly they do n't always do what the pollsters predict they will. And once again, money proved the indispensable element of campaigns for everybody but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who? Among Republicans, the debate centered on who could legitimately claim his conservative legacy and retain some of his electoral magic. For the most conservative element in the party, it also was the year to determine whether they or <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> moderates, represented by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would control the party in the post-Reagan era. The Democrats looked forward to a presidential campaign without <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the ballot, but also were aware they had lost four of the last five national elections, being virtually shut out in the South and West. They, too, talked of a fight for control of the party's future. Both parties started out with bumper crops of candidates and near candidates. Remember <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>? A former <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman, White House chief of staff and <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, he had a resume that rivaled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and a speaking style that was a sure cure for insomnia. He appeared at Republican events around the country trying to drum up support for a presidential bid before finally giving up on April 2, 1987. Former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, best known as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s close friend, also dipped a toe into the presidential waters but pulled it out when he discovered how tough it could be to raise millions of dollars. Conseratives were titillated by the prospect that <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director, or <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador would run. Both eventually said no. The Democrats had their share of reluctant dragons. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> considered running and then did n't; Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said, no, no, a thousand times no. Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and his governor, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, decided against running. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wanted to run but found raising enough money too great a hurdle. And then, of course, there was the ubiquitous Governor <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I will not be a candidate,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declared in 1987, setting off still more speculation on whether or not he was running. `` Why do n't you want to be president?'' he was asked a year later. `` Who said I do n't want to be president?'' he retorted. `` Do you want to be president?'' pressed the questioner. `` No,'' he replied. But there plenty of real candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and former secretary of state <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on the Republican side. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for the Democrats. The race began early with Democrats <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> taking the traditional route throught the small towns of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, campaigning for legislative candidates in the 1986 elections. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> did much the same thing on the Republican side. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Republicans tried to grab some of the presidential campaign spotlight. In the summer of 1986, they elected thousands of precinct level party officials who eventually would decide the allocation of the state's 77-member delegation to the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August 1988. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign liked the idea. The vice president beat <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 1980 primary. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was already at work and his forces matched the vice president's at the crucial task of recruiting candidates for the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> election. That was the first indication of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s potential It was bad news for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and even worse for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Then came Iran-Contra and the disclosures that the administration had been involved in covert arms sales to the Ayatollah. It was a bleak moment for the administration and it looked like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be the principal political victim. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s advisers were split on the likely impact, but the senator was among those who thought it would severely wound <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I thought it was serious,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager. `` But I never thought it would deprive the vice president of the nomination.'' <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s economy would prove an even greater hurdle for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, things had gone from bad to worse in the state and it was one of the few soft spots in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s generally strong approval from Americans <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigned there as a fellow Midwesterner with a rural background and an understanding of the problems of farmers. `` I'm from <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and proud of it,'' he told countless audiences. The campaign began to get nasty. `` He's sort of had a charmed life in politics, he's gotten quite a ways without ever doing much,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said of the vice president. As <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> continued to portray <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a vice president who had no more than a passive role in administration affairs, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign accused the senator of being `` mean-spirited'' and practicing `` cronyism.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> later accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of deliberately trying to provoke him. `` I think that was the effort,'' he said. `` I was a bit testy a time or two. I was getting angry.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> surrendered today after pleading guilty to strangling a young woman during a Central Park tryst. His plea ended the 10-week-long `` preppie murder'' trial that focused attention on the lifestyles of the young rich. Chambers, 21, admitted guilt Friday to a lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter, halting jury deliberations that lasted nine days and raised fears of a possible mistrial. Chambers' plea calls for a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, and he surrendered about 10:30 a.m. today at <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where he began processing before being sent to the city jail at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Formal sentencing is scheduled April 15. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> admitted that he intended to seriously hurt <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, 18, the night of her death. Her battered, partly nude body was found under a tree behind the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 26, 1986. The agreement under which he made his plea was approved by Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s family. Chambers must serve five years before being eligible for parole. `` I'll feel better ... when he's in jail, where he should be,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, the victim's mother. `` He was n't the lily-white altar boy he appeared to be.'' During the trial, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' defense had been that he had lashed out at <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> when she hurt him during rough sex, and that he had not meant to kill her. Chambers' parents, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, stared silently and showed no emotion as their only child reluctantly entered his plea. He seemed both angry and sad as he stood before <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, who asked Chambers whether he had `` intended to cause serious physical injury'' to Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> _ the key element for the manslaughter charge. `` Looking back on everthing, I'd have to say yes,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> replied in a lowered voice as he appeared to choke back sobs. `` In my heart that is not what I intended.'' The jury could have convicted Chambers of second-degree murder, a more serious charge, but <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said the prospect of a possible mistrial, the strain on the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family and the circumstantial evidence in a murder trial prompted the plea bargain. A prosecution source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that among their considerations were notes from three jurors who wanted to leave, leading to the concern over a mistrial. The source spoke only on condition of anonymity. The slaying was dubbed the `` preppie murder'' because the victim and the prime suspect were products of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s monied elite, who went to private schools and came from wealthy families. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a former altar boy, flunked out of the exclusive <PERSON> Choate </PERSON> school before entering and graduating from York Prep in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. He dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in his first year and developed a cocaine habit for which he was institutionalized twice. To help feed the habit, he committed burglaries, a prosecutor said. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who had been charged with three counts of burglary, pleaded guilty to one of those counts Friday. Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> went to the park with <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> after telling friends he was the best sex partner she ever had and that she was determined to have sex with him that night. Shortly after his arrest, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told police in a videotaped statement that he had never intended to hurt Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. He said she had molested him sexually and hurt his genitals, and he killed her accidentally. He said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> had tied his hands behind his back with her panties, sat on his chest facing his feet and grabbed his genitals. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said he freed his hands, reached up with his left forearm and yanked back against her throat, flipping her off him. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> called Chambers' story `` ludicrous. She told the jury that he attacked Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> in a rage, punched her, chased her when she tried to flee, caught her and `` squeezed the life out of her.'' <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON>, holding a photo of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> taken in <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s Red Hand bar hours before her death, said, `` One ca n't help but look at that photograph and pray for time to stand still, for time to grab her and say, ` Do n't go with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>.'''

 The Legislature today approved a bill giving Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> unprecedented power to deal with <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s fiscal crisis by slashing government spending, after several lawmakers said the state had no other choice. By a 32-4 vote in special session Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sent the budget-cutting bill to the House for consideration of amendments. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> concurred by a 101-0 vote today, sending the measure to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s desk for his signature. Under the bill, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> would have the authority until June 30 to cut up to 20 percent from department budgets, eliminate entire programs and close institutions if necessary to keep the state from running out of cash. The governor has said the state will run out of money sometime in early May if emergency steps are not taken. The special legislative session to consider his program was to continue today. In proposing the legislation, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said lawmakers would be able to reverse his cuts while formulating the budget during the regular legislative session beginning April 18. At the center of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate was the issue of whether the Legislature should be handing over such authority. Sen. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> questioned the constitutionality of the bill. `` We're supposed to have a constitutional separation of powers,'' he said. But other lawmakers said the state had no other practical choice. `` It is either this or a much greater evil,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Windhorst </PERSON>. `` If we do n't like what he does, we can undo it during the regular session.'' Also Friday, lawmakers sent to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> a bill that is the keystone of the governor's plans to reorganize state government _ the splitting of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> into two agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 97-3, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later concurred with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> amendments. The measure is aimed at better management of health and welfare services that fall under the agency's $ 2 billion budget. With about 27,000 employees, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> is the state's largest agency and is the frequent target of charges of mismanagement. The bill would create two agencies: one to deal with welfare and other social programs and the other to supervise health and hospital programs. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill that would allow <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> to reappropriate funds in his office without legislative approval and another measure authorizing a delay in the state's final 1987-88 revenue sharing payment of about $ 30 million to city governments from May 15 to June 30. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval to the revenue sharing measure today.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met today with two members of a group affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will got to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next week to again push a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative. Professors <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> met for more than an hour with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who had invited them to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We conveyed to Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> the urgent need to lift <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> as a preparatory step on the road to achieving peaceful coexistence between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews,'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> said after the meeting. The professor earlier said he had been in touch with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> about the meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rejected news organizations' requests to photograph <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the Palestinian leaders, both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, at the start of their meeting. The secretary, whose last <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace-seeking trip was a month ago, has been trying to arrange negotiations that would lead to a settlement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejects <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in any negotiations. Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made the decision to return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on Friday after meeting <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, his chief negotiator on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> problems. He will arrive in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Sunday, April 3, and visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> the following week, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called the visitors `` prominent Americans with an intimate knowledge of contemporary Middle Eastern politics.'' She also confirmed they are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is often called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative arm Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, administration officials are barred from holding meetings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, but Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> stressed that the two guests are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and said the meeting did not represent a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization. Asked in a telephone interview Friday if he received permission from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to attend the session, <PERSON> Said </PERSON> replied he did not need such a `` green light.'' He added, however, `` We did notify Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and that was fine with him _ absolutely.'' He said he and Abu-Lughud were interested in `` an exchange of views'' with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. They want to know more about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations and `` we're going to tell him about the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' view of the matter,'' Said commented. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> protested <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s invitation to the two as in conflict with a 13-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is pledged to dismantling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state. For several weeks, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been trying to open negotiations by May 1 to provide self-rule for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and move toward an overall <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace agreement. The plan, designed to overcome <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> objections to talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, envisions participation in talks by PLO-approved Palestinians as part of a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation. None of the parties in the region has accepted the plan. In January, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met here with two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> editor, and <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer. During a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> shuttle trip last month, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> tried to arrange a meeting in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with 15 Palestinian Arabs, but none showed up, apparently by order of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, issued a warning to Americans not to travel to the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where 111 Palestinians and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed in clashes since January 9. There was no explanation for the timing of the advisory, but it coincided with the approach of Easter and Passover holidays that usually attract <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists to the holy land, including sites on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is safe for American travel, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was held by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from 1949 until 1967 when the Arabs lost the territories to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the Six-Day War. About 96 percent of the population is <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>. The situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was described as `` unpredictable'' and Americans were advised to check with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in the city before entering the area. `` Under all circumstances, Americans should avoid demonstrations and other situations that have the potential to lead to violence,'' the advisory said. `` American travelers should carry their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports at all times.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defeat last week on a major anti-discrimination bill demonstrates the chasm between his administration and the rest of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when it comes to civil rights, say those who fought for passage of the measure. Some conservatives counter that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s positions are very much in tune with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mainstream. The enactment of the Civil Rights Restoration Act over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto was the latest skirmish in the administration's rocky seven-year attempt to redefine _ and some say erase _ the federal government's role in ensuring basic rights to all citizens <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his conservative allies contend they are committed to a `` colorblind'' society and reject the idea that they are less concerned about discrimination than those who support stronger remedies. But their vision has led to years of confrontation with Democrats and liberals and often with moderates, conservatives, Republicans and business people as well. `` People simply do n't want to go back and undo things that have been accomplished over the last 20 years,'' says veteran civil rights attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who helped draft the restoration act. But some conservatives say the administration's victories have not drawn the attention they deserve and do, in fact, reflect the public's feelings. `` The picture is more mixed than perhaps some would have people think about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and its civil rights policy and how much it's in sync with the public,'' said former Associate Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, now a fellow at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Fein said the media has not fairly portrayed the administration's progress toward its civil rights goals. `` On the victories, they end up with a little three-graf snippet on page 25,'' he complained. But <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the 185-group <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said the victories have been small and-or temporary. `` Congress and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> have reined in the excesses of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' he said. `` The only time they -LRB- the administration -RRB- have been able to do anything or change anything is when they have acted by executive fiat.'' The administration provoked an uproar early in 1982 when it tried to reverse a longstanding policy of not giving tax breaks to segregated schools and caused more controversy a year later by firing three liberal members of the supposedly independent <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Among other things, the administration has also tried and failed to: _ Block strong economic sanctions against the South African government for its apartheid policy _ Dismantle or weaken ongoing school busing and affirmative action plans _ End affirmative action goals and timetables for government contractors _ Block a tough new extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982 and win a different interpretation of it three years later in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ Dissuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from enacting a new holiday honoring <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> _ Elevate the architect of its civil rights policies, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, to associate attorney general Those are the major defeats. Where are the comparable victories? Some point to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 decision narrowing protection under four civil rights laws to specific federally assisted programs, rather than prohibiting an entire institution from discriminating if any part of it receives aid. But that ruling was reversed last week with the veto override. There were also two <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings in which the justices found newer minority employees were improperly shielded from layoffs while innocent white workers with more seniority were let go. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> later was rebuffed when it asked 51 local jurisdictions to scrap hiring and promotion plans on the basis of the court rulings on seniority and layoffs. One Republican mayor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said he refused to comply with the request because he felt it was wrong constitutionally, morally and politically. The high court went on to deal a double blow to the administration in 1986, approving the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to reserve half of all promotions for minority candidates and endorsing a labor union's use of racial quotas to help more minorities get jobs Fein cited several lower court rulings that threw out racial quotas in government contracting and said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would review them. He also noted a federal appeals court decision this month striking down racial quotas used to avert `` white flight'' at an integrated <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> housing development, <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The decision stemmed from a 1984 suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and others in the civil rights community do say that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has succeeded in dismantling much of the federal civil rights law enforcement machinery and has kept advocates busy for seven years with rearguard actions. On the other hand, they say, in their forced re-examination and re-evaluation of the nation's civil rights policies, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the courts have deemed them essentially sound. `` The basic threat the administration posed was turning the clock back and turning the country in a different direction,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` They sure tried hard. They failed every time. To me, that is a very encouraging development.''

 Here is a chronology of U.S.-Nicaraguan relations, dating back nearly a decade. It ends with the Sandinistas and Contra rebels signing a tentative peace accord last week: 1979 JULY 17 _ <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, the Nicaraguan president, resigns and flies to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, ending more than four decades of rule by his rightist, pro-American family. <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> had been weakened from both inside and outside the country. His refusal to allow democracy and freedom alienated businessmen, professionals and students, while his ties to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were weakened by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s concerns about human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Two days after <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> flees, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> rebels take control of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dies in 1980. 1982 NOVEMBER _ First reports emerge alleging covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to anti-Sandinista rebels. The aid actually had begun secretly in 1981 as part of legislation on intelligence activities and had been managed by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. 1983 MAY 1 _ <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> claims violations of its territory by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy planes and warships. 1984 APRIL 6-7 _ Congressional and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sources reveal that U.S.-trained commando units, operating from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship off the Nicaraguan coast and directed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, had placed mines in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ports. APRIL 9 _ <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> asks the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to order the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to halt the mining and cease aiding attacks on Nicaraguan territory. A day earlier, in anticipation of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s move, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had announced that, for a two-year period, it would not accept the court's jurisdiction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disputes involving <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

JAN. 18 _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdraws from <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> proceedings involving <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s suit against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression, claiming the case presents political questions `` that under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Charter are not intended for the World Court.'' MAY 1 _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announces a trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. AUG. 8 _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signs a foreign aid bill into law that resumes aid to the Contras _ $ 27 million in `` non-lethal'' assistance. 1986 MARCH 20 _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defeats <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal for $ 100 million in military and humanitarian aid to the Contras.

AUG. 13 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 100 million aid package for the Contra guerillas. OCT. 5 _ An American-manned military cargo plane is shot down in southern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Two Americans are killed; the surviving crew member, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON>, is captured and implicates the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in the Contra-supply operation. NOV. 25 _ Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> discloses that some of the profits from the sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been secretly diverted to the Contras.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday that pre-summit talks have `` made clear how difficult the issues are between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' and it remains to be seen how much good the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit will do. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened his weekly radio address with a review of his meeting Wednesday with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, during which he announced that he and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29 through June 2. `` My talks with him were cordial but, as you might expect, to the point,'' he said. `` Let me also say that while lengthy talks held between Secretary -LRB- of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were useful, they also made clear how difficult the issues are between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the president added. `` Some progress was made here and there in various areas, but much more remains to be done, given the importance of the topics discussed.'' Touching on arms control, human rights and other issues between the two countries, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his audience that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will sign only those agreements that are in our best interest.'' `` We've come a long way in our attempts to deal with the Soviets and to further the cause of peace and freedom around the world,'' the president said. `` The next summit will help,'' he said. `` How much we'll have to see.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also used his speech to urge <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the treaty limiting intermediate - and shorter-range missiles that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote on the treaty during the coming week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also discussed an international trade bill being considered by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, saying some administration objections to it have been met but that it `` still contains provisions that would restrict trade, deter investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, require mandatory retaliation that invites trade wars, and unnecessarily hamper my prerogatives as president.'' `` For example, one proposal still very much alive would create an obligation for the government to help each and every company that ca n't keep up with legal, totally fair imports _ in effect, an entitlement program for businesses that ca n't compete,'' he said. He urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` stay on course and ... settle on a bill that avoids the great danger of choking off international trade and slowing down economic growth.'' `` I will not sign a bill that imperils our economy and threatens growth,'' he said.

 State District Judge <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> says he understands a man's fondness for his cowboy hat, but do n't try wearing one in his court. `` The judge asked if I would remove it and said he could give me six months or a $ 5,000 fine,'' said <PERSON> Keven </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaird </PERSON>. `` I told him I would n't, his gavel fell, and it was 10 days in the county jail.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> sentenced the General Dynamics toolmaker for contempt of court Monday for refusing to take off his hat in a jury assembly room.

<HEAD>EPA Faults Sewage Treatment Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says that three out of four municipal waste treatment plants it surveyed are n't able to stop water pollution from industrial toxics. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> audit, made public at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing last week, is likely to rekindle a long-standing debate over whether the agency has properly enforced the anti-toxics provisions of the Clean Water Act. The audit focused on 265 of the 1,500 publicly owned sewage treatment plants with EPA-approved plans, which are supposed to minimize the amount of toxics reaching the environment. The audit said that 57 plants have been generally unsuccessful in carrying out their plans, while another 147 plants have been only partially successful in meeting the EPA-approved goals. Only 61 plants _ 23 percent of the total surveyed _ `` have implemented a generally successful program and are effectively carrying out program responsibilities,'' the audit said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permits </ORGANIZATION>, said the audit indicates `` that the toxic impacts on receiving waters from publicly owned treatment works is more significant than previously thought.'' The audit focused on the so-called pre-treatment aspects of the Clean Water Act, which is considered one of the nation's most successful environmental laws because it has halted much direct discharging of untreated human waste into waterways. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, between 100,000 and 200,000 industrial concerns of varying size pump their wastes directly into sewers along with the wastes of millions of households and other non-toxic sources. The municipal plants are geared principally to treat human and other organic matter so it can be pumped into waterways with minimal environmental impact. Toxic waste from industry, however, remains largely untreated in the process, exiting plants either in the pumpings into waterways or trapped in sewage sluge, the residue that is disposed of in a variety of ways, including landfills. In order to minimize the amount of toxics reaching a treatment plant, the law requires manufacturers to pre-treat waste to remove chemicals, often an expensive proposition. Under the pre-treatment program, begun in the mid-1970s, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> generally leaves it up to municipalities to police the toxic sources for compliance with EPA-approved pre-treatment plans. The audit, with findings similar to a smaller survey in in 1985, showed that 104 of the 267 plants had basically failed to implement their pre-treatment programs. The audit also said that municipalities are also hampered in the battle against toxic waste in the sewage stream by inadequate legal authority, ineffective enforcement and too little money committed to the job. `` The results are shocking,'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubrowski </PERSON>, a lawyer formerly with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told the hearing by two <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittees that are taking an in-depth look at pollution of coastal waters. `` Extrapolating this data nationwide, some 500 to 900 -LRB- plants -RRB- merited enforcement for failure to implement the pre-treatment program as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended,'' she said. `` Yet <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> referred only 10 enforcement cases for failing to implement pre-treatment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Elder said that while increased emphasis on the toxics problem is `` making an impact, I agree we still have a lot to do.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dubrowski </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should require treatment plants to develop local limits for 126 toxics cited by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1987 updating of the Clean Water Act. EPA has issued requirements for only 10. She also said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should finally issue standards to regulate the toxic content of sewage sludge, which can contaminate groundwater if deposited in a leaking landfill. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> missed sludge standards deadlines in 1978 and 1987, but officials say standards are in the works. Ms. <PERSON> Dubrowski </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the states might need to take a more active role enforcing pre-treatment requirements, rather than leaving this to municipalities `` For a city to decide to take action against its biggest employer takes a big dose of political backbone,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said. `` But it's very clear a major part of the problem is political will at all levels of government.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said that unless enforcement is brought against more violators of the Clean Water Act, `` it's like the drug traffickers: they do n't feel a risk because the chances of their being targeted are very low.''

<HEAD>City Corruption: The Shakedowns Go On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shaking down shopkeepers. Taking protection money from criminals. Dealing drugs. Collecting kickbacks. Demanding bribes. This, prosecutors say, is how some municipal employees spend their days. The problem is as old as government and the prognosis for a cure is as bleak as ever. `` There's always going to be people who take advantage of the system. Eight percent of the Apostles were corrupt, and look at who screened them,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> displayed the latest example of his thesis last week, announcing charges that 28 current and former city health inspectors and supervisors extorted payoffs from restaurateurs by threatening sanitary law citations. The alleged scam may have been `` repellent and painful,'' as Health Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said, but it was not particularly new or clever. `` It's a classic shakedown situation,'' said <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. It was just another in a long string of cases alleging municipal corruption in the city in recent years, ranging from high officials taking massive kickbacks to functionaries skimming or extorting cash. `` It's pretty simple: human nature and greed,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON>, the city commissioner of investigation. `` It's going after something that is tempting to you, which is an easy buck.'' The local <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, blamed some of the temptation on the city government itself. `` The vast majority of government workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are honest and competent _ and grossly underpaid,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` If you want to maintain integrity in any profession, you must pay a living wage to the employees. Government is not doing that today, and that is part of their problem.'' The end result: corruption that runs across the range of government activities. Among the most prominent is the case of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a military contractor accused of paying off state and federal politicians for favored treatment. Another is the <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> case, in which some top city political leaders were convicted of taking kickbacks for contracts. But if those lead the list, it is the litany of cases that indicate the extent of corruption: _ In a sting operation revealed in January, state prosecutors said court representatives stole property from the apartments of people they thought had died without family or a will _ In October, 35 workers for a company hired by the city to empty the cash from parking meters were accused of skimming nearly $ 1 million in quarters _ In July, authorities charged that guards at a city yard where illegally parked cars are towed took bribes to release vehicles to their owners _ In May, nine current or former maintenance workers and supervisors in the city school system were indicted in a nine-year kickback scheme; 19 people were charged in 1986 _ In November 1986, prosecutors charged more than a dozen police officers at the 77th Precinct in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> with crimes ranging from selling cocaine to stealing garbage cans _ In June 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON> sentenced two former <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officials to prison for extorting kickback money <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, `` Corruption is turning the city into a cesspool.'' <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON>, the city's in-house corruption investigator, has another view: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> corruption is no greater than in other governments or in private business, he said. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, grifters get caught. `` It's a two-edged sword. You go after it vigorously, you announce arrests. And the public perception is, ` Oh, well, more corruption,''' <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> said. `` If you closed your eyes you would n't see it This agency and the federal government work very hard to expose it.'' Indeed, <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s local office has beefed up its corruption squad and the budget for his own department has doubled since 1985. `` We have a number of active investigations'' he said. Just since the restaurant inspectors arrests, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office has received several calls reporting graft in government, enough to persuade it to open a 24-hour hotline for corruption tips this week. `` We're looking harder than we ever have,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` You say there's been a lot of cases. There are more coming.''

<TEXT>
 The cease-fire pact between the Sandinistas and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels puts new pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to hold direct talks with the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> government _ something <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has long refused to do. It also highlights how little progress <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have made in negotiating cease-fires under a regional peace plan. Before last week's agreement, many observers doubted the leftist Sandinistas would ever make political concessions to the U.S.-backed Contras. For years, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> flatly refused to talk to the rebels. The Nicaraguan government insisted the only path to peace was direct negotiations with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which it saw as the true instigator of the civil war. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would only talk to the Sandinistas after they and the Contras made significant headway toward settling their differences. That headway appears to have been made and, after signing the pact Wednesday in the border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> renewed his call for direct talks with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The last U.S.-Nicaragua talks were in 1984. `` Now is the time for the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to respect the force of peace and dispose itself to normalizing its relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. On Friday, however, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration has no plans for direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` We would be willing to talk on a multilateral, regional basis,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says it is skeptical about the Sandinista promises made in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. In the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised to gradually end the more than six-year war, restore all democratic freedoms and grant amnesty to political prisoners. In so doing, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> could become the first Central American nation other than <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> _ which has no war and no armed forces _ to fully comply with the accord signed Aug. 7, 1987, by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> nor <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, have come close to working out agreements with their leftist insurgents. Chronic guerrilla wars persist in both countries. When they began the cease-fire talks last Monday, the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> faced intense pressure. Overt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels had recently ended, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was having trouble convincing lawmakers that it should resume. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has backed the Contras since 1981, but <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> funding has been an on-again-off-again proposition. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> faced pressure from chronic food shortages, the military draft and an economy shattered by a war that the government says has cost more than $ 3 billion and killed more than 50,000. The Soviet bloc supplies the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which contends the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are the beachhead of a hemispheric communist threat, stopped economic aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1981 and imposed a trade embargo in 1985. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> moved to comply with <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' peace plan by lifting a state of emergency that had barred most basic freedoms since 1982. It resulted in the most open expressions of discontent since the leftists came to power in a 1979 revolution. There have been demonstrations, strikes, media criticism and public complaints that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> reneged on their revolutionary pledge of democracy by becoming a Marxist regime. But Sandinista critics in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are now praising the agreement with the Contras, in contrast to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's pessimism. `` Perhaps the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will finally comply with its word,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, head of a private enterprise council. The Contras say they will resume fighting if the agreement falls through. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, in their newspaper Barricada, said Friday the Contra war is moving from the battleground to the political arena. It said the Contras, `` even though disarmed, continue to be armed ideologically against the popular power and its conquests.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for designing the regional plan, said the Nicaraguan pact offers `` a new and firm hope that all Central Americans can live in peace.'' The regional plan is aimed at ending the wars in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It calls for political amnesties, democratic reforms, and an end to support for insurgencies _ but the key provision is the one calling for cease-fires. So far, the only one to be reached in the region is the one between the Sandinistas and the Contras, who suspended offensive military operations Monday and agreed to begin a formal 60-day cease-fire on April 1.

 Tens of thousands of people marched through central <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Saturday to call for more job opportunities for women and tougher laws against sexual abuse. Organizers estimated that 100,000 people took part in the afternoon demonstration, in which marchers slowly made their way across the city's historic center. The marchers, including large numbers of men as well as women, came from all parts of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by car, train and special buses. They carried banners, chanted slogans and blew whistles. The demonstration was organized by the country's three main labor federations. Their slogan was `` A job for everyone. A different kind of work. A society without violence.'' They are seeking more jobs and better conditions for women, including flexible schedules for working mothers. The groups noted that the national unemployment rate for women is 19 percent, compared with 8 percent for men, with 32 percent of women without jobs in the Mezzogiorno, the underdeveloped south. The women are also pushing for new laws against sexual violence, with the aim of making a sexual offense a crime `` against the person'' rather than a crime `` against morals'' as it is considered now.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should show his support of the Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement by refraining from pushing for renewed military aid for the Contra rebels, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader said Saturday. `` Old policies _ like old habits _ die hard.

<HEAD>Three Striking Showbiz Unions Go On Spring Offensive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top television series such as `` The Cosby Show'' and `` Moonlighting'' have had their seasons shortened and anxious advertisers have broken ranks to sign separate contracts as scriptwriters and commercial actors turn up the heat in their strikes. Hollywood labor's spring offensive against motion picture and television producers and advertisers has put more than 109,000 people on strike and forced more than 1,100 others out of their jobs due to the resulting shutdown of projects. The action has cost workers $ 4 million in lost salaries and benefits and threatened network advertising revenue by forcing early reruns. On Monday, the 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> enters the fourth week of its strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. Guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said Friday that informal talks were taking place between the union and producers; alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> refused comment. Meanwhile, 100,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> who work on commercials enter the second week of a strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION>. The actors, many of whom make their livings off commercials, and advertisers have agreed to meet April 6. Of the two labor actions, the writers strike has done the most immediate damage to the industry. Networks will be forced to show reruns as early as next month in order to save some new product for the critical May `` sweeps'' ratings period, when advertising rates for local stations are determined. Among the shows that will fall short of a full schedule this season are <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' short one show; `` L.A. Law,'' short two shows, and `` The Cosby Show,'' short three episodes, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a spokesman for `` Cosby's'' <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>. `` It hurts,'' said <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>. `` Those were three scripts that were n't written, and three shows that wo n't be produced. And you ca n't make those up later.'' In addition, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live,'' `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' and `` The Tonight Show'' will all be in reruns until the strike is resolved. A much-publicized 3-D sequence for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moonlighting'' that was to be shown during the May sweeps will not be produced. Last week's `` Moonlighting'' episode ended early, leaving the cast filling in with a lip-synched rendition of the rock oldie `` Wooly Bully.'' Stars <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> explained the script could n't be lengthened because the writers were on strike. Also shut down on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is `` thirtysomething,'' one episode shy of a full season, which is usually 25 episodes. On CBS, three shows in production were affected, with replacement series `` The Dictator,'' starring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, taken off the schedule for its March 15 debut. Only six of eight shows were shot for `` Coming of Age,'' a new half-hour comedy. The new `` <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>'' will go ahead with at least three shows written before the strike. Daytime soap operas, usually the first affected by a talent union strike, were able to stockpile several weeks of scripts, although some could be in trouble by mid-April. On the advertising strike front, there were signs of erosion in management solidarity with separate interim contracts being signed between SAG and <ORGANIZATION> AFTRA </ORGANIZATION> and 41 advertising agencies and 42 production companies. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinn </PERSON>, chief negotiator for the advertisers, said he had expected the interim agreements. `` When they sign P & amp; G -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, which has a massive advertising budget -RRB-, I'll take note,'' he said. Writers struck over creative control, demands for a greater share of residuals for foreign-distributed products and rejection of producers' reformulation of residuals for syndicated one-hour television shows. Writers made more than $ 57 million in residuals last year. The two sides are so far apart that the producers claim their offer is a $ 50 million increase over the life of the three-year-contract, while guild officials claim it would be a $ 37.8 million loss. The guild says its own package would net its members an $ 8.7 million increase. Actors striking against advertisers want to keep a cost-of-living formula written into their contract 10 years ago, and seek a new formula for increased residuals for commercials shown on cable television. Advertisers say they have offered significant increases for all types of fees in return for surrendering the cost-of-living clause.

<TEXT>
 Here is a text of the Democratic radio address delivered Saturday by Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif.: This is Congressman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> There is no harder decision in a nation's life than to abandon a failed course even at a time new policies could promise success. History is never generous in offering such moments, and it seldom selects leaders with the wisdom to seize them. But one such moment arrived late Wednesday in a Central American border town. Two hardened enemies _ the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras _ decided to stop killing each other and signed a plan bringing political freedom to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should honor this pact and their courage for signing it. The Contras showed great character simply by sitting down with the Nicaraguan government. Days before, Sandinista troops crossed the Honduran border and jeopardized the Contra's war supplies. Honoring engrained habits, the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leadership could easily have appealed to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> anger and urged renewed military aid. This they did not do. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also resisted the practices of the past. When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> deployed 3,200 American soldiers in support of the Hondurans, many predicted <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would break off the peace talks and ask <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a fresh infusion of weapons. Such a request would have likely rendered <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s cycle of war unbreakable; its search for peace unachievable. But after six years of battle, and 40,000 Nicaraguans dead, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras concluded that war had become a cowardly and costly escape from the problems of peace. Instead, they negotiated an historic accord that offered a road to democracy for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and new avenues of aid for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The agreement provides a 60-day cease-fire, an amnesty for political prisoners, and freedom for estranged Nicaraguans to return home. It guarantees press freedom and rights for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION>'s opponents to run for political office. In almost every respect, this accord satisfies the concerns which prompted us to fund the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> war in the first place. The agreement bears the witness of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And it assigns the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a role to ensure fulfillment. Under its terms, we can provide strictly humanitarian aid to the Contras, providing the aid is delivered to the resistance forces by neutral parties. If it works, the agreement will take on the aspect of modern art, with Republicans and Democrats each finding in it qualities that conform to their own political agendas. Any politician who wants to claim credit will surely do so, but let's remember one central point: Nicaraguans from both sides of the civil war have closed ranks behind a blueprint for peace. And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will underscore their efforts or undermine the agreement depending upon how we respond. Old policies _ like old habits _ die hard. We must resist the temptation to say `` we know better'' by approving military aid before the peace plan has a chance to succeed. The burden on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to recognize that diplomacy works, join our call to end partisanship, and make peace his highest priority. Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wants to put the new agreement to the test. He's ready to schedule a vote on a humanitarian aid bill next week If our Republican colleagues help us write and pass a plan, we can speed humanitarian aid to the Contras. And the chance for a truly bipartisan policy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would be at hand. At another time, at another struggle, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: `` A revolution is coming _ a revolution which will be peaceful if we are wise enough; compassionate if we care enough; successful if we are fortunate enough. While we can not alter its inevitability,'' he wrote, `` we can affect its character.'' This is the moment all Nicaraguans have been waiting to seize. But in a very real sense, it is our moment too. They have pledged to bury past hatreds and forge new beginnings. We can do the same. This week, Americans welcomed the arrival of spring and prepared to observe the Easter and Passover holidays. It is a time to celebrate rebirth and redemption of people and the resurrection of a savior. It is a time for renewal. This year, in the prayers of all Americans, let us remember the struggle and the sacrifice of the Nicaraguan people, who have known too much war, too much repression, and too little freedom. Let us hope, this time that they find the peace that has eluded them for generations. Thank you, and God bless you.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday: My fellow Americans, this week, as our thoughts begin to turn toward Easter, the cause of peace among nations is foremost in our minds, a cause that was also at the top of our work agenda here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as I received Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the White House. My talks with him were cordial, but, as you might expect, to the point. During Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s stay, I announced May 29 through June 2 as the dates for my summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. And, of course, this was good news. The last U.S.-Soviet Summit in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> was 14 years ago. So this meeting will give me and, in a sense, you the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, an opportunity to convey the message of peace and freedom to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people. But let me also say that while lengthy talks held between Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were useful, they also made clear how difficult the issues are between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now some progress was made here and there in various areas, but there's much more that needs to be done given the importance of the topics discussed. Our agenda with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> deals not only with arms reductions, but also regional matters, human rights, and people-to-people exchanges. And as our discussions continue in each of these areas I can assure you that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will sign only those agreements that are in our best interest. Let me also assure you as negotiations continue on efforts to further reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear arms, that my administration will carefully review such proposals. Still, we've come a long way in our attempts to deal with the Soviets and to further the cause of peace and freedom around the world The next Summit will help; how much, we'll have to see. An important accomplishment of the first few summits however, will be before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next week for approval. This is the INF Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I signed when he was here for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Summit last December. It's an important vote, and I'm hopeful the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will, as it exercises its Constitutional duty, speedily approve what amounts to the first real nuclear arms reductions ever achieved. Now, some of you heard me say before that our progress with the Soviets is based on their awareness that we have no illusions about them. And on our determination to deal from a position of strength. Now, that strength means, of course, keeping our defenses ready and second to none. But it also means a strong and vigorous economy and a place for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as the world leader in trade. That's one of the other matters that is being considered in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that is of critical importance. That is the legislative conference on trade legislation. Last year, there was trade legislation coming through the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would have meant serious risks to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity, and indeed, the world's. Fortunately, working with our administration, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has made some progress in producing a sounder bit of legislation. Now, the legislation now before the conference committee still contains provisions that would restrict trade, deter investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, require mandatory retaliation that invites trade wars, and unnecessarily hamper my perogatives as President. For example, one proposal still very much alive would create an obligation for the government to help each and every company that ca n't keep up with legal, totally fair imports. In effect, an entitlement program for businesses that ca n't compete. So my hope is that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will stay on course. And that we will settle on a bill that avoids the great danger of choking off international trade and slowing down economic growth. I will not sign a bill that imperils our economy and threatens growth. And by the way, that economic growth keeps coming right along. Only this week we heard that the gross national product growth for last year was four percent. Now, this was higher than our own expectations. Expectations that by the way were criticized as too rosey a scenario when we first made them. Well, the rosey scenario was even rosier than the one the critics were down on. It just shows what can happen when spending and taxes are held down, and trade is encouraged. In fact, right now much of our economy is being driven by the growth in exports that bad trade legislation would discourage. So you can see there's much on our minds this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. And before anyone looks prematurely forward to the arrival of the Easter Bunny, I hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will stay focused on the important matters this week; the INF treaty, and trade legislation. Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 Congressional and administration negotiators have agreed to give the president authority to block foreign takeovers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies if the change in ownership would threaten national security. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials agreed Thursday to support the provision in a catch-all trade bill pending in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said Friday The president would not be required block a foreign takeover, `` but if anyone calls to the attention of the president a threat to national security, this bill gives the president the tool to stop it without declaring a national emergency,'' said <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, who had proposed a similar measure that was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees to adopt the compromise on Tuesday.

The compromise would give the president or someone he designates the power to investigate a takeover or a merger when a foreign person or company is involved. The investigation would be limited to 45 days, a provision added to re-assure the business community that it would n't be prolonged. The president then would decide whether to intervene by issuing an executive order. During the negotiations, several changes were made at the administration's insistence, <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. Those changes included dropping a provision that would have allowed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to veto a presidential decision to block a takeover and the addition of assurances that any information obtained during the investigation from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or the foreign entity involved would be kept confidential.

<HEAD>Armenians Empty Streets in Silent Protest, Dissidents Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Armenians abandoned the streets of their capital to soldiers and attack dogs Saturday to protest an official crackdown that prompted activists to cancel a nationalist demonstration, dissidents said. One activist said most Armenians heeded the call to stay inside and made <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> look like a ghost town. `` There are no children outside, no cars on the street, no activity whatsoever except for the troops occupying the city. <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> is like a dead city,'' said Christian rights activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, who said he talked to witnesses by telephone. The vast majority of people in Armenian-dominated <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, in the neighboring republican of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, also refused to go outside, the dissidents' reports said. Armenians campaigning for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> had called for protests Saturday, when an unofficial committee spearheading the drive was to meet. But authorities threatened criminal action against those taking part in illegal protests in the region south of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has been part of the overwhelmingly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> republic since 1923. Most Armenians are Christians, and many fear the ethnic character of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is being diluted. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Armenian church official <PERSON> Tiran </PERSON> <PERSON> Gureghian </PERSON> said about 15 young Armenians gathered Saturday at a small church inside <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Armenian cemetery to discuss <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gureghian </PERSON> said police prevented them from going into the cemetery, which had been posted with a sign advising visitors to obtain permits before entering. An Armenian telephone operator said in a phone interview that 20 to 30 people gathered near the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Opera Theater, the scene of huge demonstrations last month. The operator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that group was also talking about <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The operator said Armenians were disappointed that their demands for annexation had been rejected. `` They believed it would be ours. It probably wo n't be,'' she said. Police patrolled <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s streets and helicopters crisscrossed its skies. Radio <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, appealed for calm and restraint. Leaders of the unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> had called off the strikes and demonstrations earlier in the week to avoid confrontation. But the Armenian government on Friday ordered police to `` put an end to the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported. Four Armenian activists were arrested Friday as authorities moved to prevent protests. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON> of the dissident journal <ORGANIZATION> Glasnost </ORGANIZATION> said he was told <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s central city, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, was occupied by 15,000 Azerbaijani policemen on Saturday. He said residents of the region were staying indoors to protest the show of force. Local authorities said little of the situation. Someone who answered the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> refused to give his name and said Saturday's activity was normal. Soviet authorities have forbidden foreign correspondents to travel to the area. It was not clear how many Armenians stayed home out of fear of confronting authorities and how many stayed home to signal their displeasure. <PERSON> Bavitsky </PERSON> said he was told 60,000 troops were patrolling <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, a city of about 640,000 people. A national newspaper accused the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership of trying to suppress the sensitive ethnic dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said authorities should have openly discussed the proposal with Armenians. The critical commentary in the party's youth newspaper contrasted sharply with articles Friday in the nation's two most official newspapers, Pravda and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. Despite its hard line, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Politburo </LOCATION> has ordered a major improvement in living conditions in the region, including improved reception of Armenian-language television programming and more Armenian literature. Soviet authorities, meanwhile, allowed nationalist displays in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on Friday, activists said. They said the displays marked the anniversary of Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s 1940 deportation of thousands of anti-communists before the Soviets took over the states on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> In the Baltic, as many as 3,000 people were reported to have joined in a nationalist display in the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> and about 5,000 in the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. One resident, Ints Zalitis of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, said human rights activists were warned against organizing mass demonstrations. He said Latvians showed up in small groups to lay flowers at a central monument, and police did not disturb those who left quickly. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Latvian newspapers reporting several hundred people gathered around <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>'s Freedom monument to make a `` blasphemous provocation.'' Nine people were detained for trespassing and disrupting transportation, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The pastor selected to lead a group of moderate Baptists for the next year says his alliance seeks only a return to religious freedom within the fundamentalist-dominated Southern Baptist Convention, But the moderates are willing to act independently, for the time being, if necessary, said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, elected president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> at its annual meeting in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> last week. The group celebrated its first year of existence by poking fun at itself and at the fundamentalists, but also worrying about what fundamentalist control is doing to the church. Delegates often likened the meeting to a family reunion, without the tensions that have grown up around their denomination's annual meeting. The alliance meetings `` have reminded us of former days when Southern Baptists could gather without hostility to learn together and share in the gospel ministry,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, who stepped down as president of the group. `` I have a home with you and do not have to explain or defend myself,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, a former missionary in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> who was elected first vice president. Leaders of the alliance insist they do not plan to split from the 14.7-million member <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest Protestant denomination At the same time, however, the alliance is publishing books, setting up an office to help place moderate pastors with moderate congregations, and discussing providing Sunday school material and the possibilities of a new Baptist seminary or divinity school. `` Whenever we take specific steps like that, we are acting independently of the institutions of the Southern Baptist Convention and that gives the appearance of independence,'' said <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, whose 561-member <ORGANIZATION> Northminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, was the third to join the alliance. The words of some of the speakers at the meeting appeared intended to keep open the door for flight. `` We would find it very uncomfortable to support indefinitely the present trend of -LRB- SBC -RRB- leadership,'' <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> said in his status report to the delegates at <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a Baptist-supported school that avoided a fundamentalist takeover attempt last year. One sentence later, however, <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> was applauded when he said, `` Pulling out has not been our goal or intention.'' <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> admitted the words and actions do n't necessarily match. But, he said, `` we have to be advocates of groups that we feel to be disenfranchised'' by the fundamentalist control of the denomination's offices. The alliance was formed in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in February 1987 by moderates who felt shut out of their church through nine years of losing the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> presidental election to fundamentalists. Although both groups are generally conservative, they differ on key points, and victorious fundamentalists have used the presidency's broad appointive powers to put their supporters on the boards of Baptist agencies and institutions. Fundamentalists maintain that the Bible is literally, word-for-word, without error, while moderates hold there is room for interpretation, especially in historical and scientific concepts. Also, fundamentalists oppose ordination of women; the alliance has made one of its main activities welcoming female pastors. The alliance unanimously passed a resolution supporting <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON>, who resigned as president of <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, rather than follow the orders of a fundamentalist-controlled board of directors that said only biblical inerrantists could be hired as professors. Another resolution decried `` restrictive understanding of Scripture,'' saying the emphasis placed on biblical inerrancy `` undermines free inquiry and diversity of opinion which have been a hallmark of Baptist life.'' Alliance leaders are quick to point out that other groups within the denomination are political, but that the alliance is philosophical, intent on upholding what it sees as Baptist principles. Many of the alliance leaders admit, however, that the convention election in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, next June may determine if moderates will retain a place in the denomination.

<HEAD>Governor's Double Life As Politician And Car Salesman Emerges At
Impeachment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two lives of <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> _ embattled governor and wheeler-dealer car salesman _ have emerged in the second act of his impeachment trial as witnesses sketch a complex saga of money, politics and family ties. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, fighting to save his political life, is in his second round of testimony in the trial as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considers the second of three charges. His son, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, has stepped forward in a supporting role to help <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> explain why an $ 80,000 loan from a protocol fund to the family car dealership was n't illegal. The governor, admitting he was `` not enthused'' about having his personal finances spread out in public, said he was told he could use the protocol fund for practically anything he wanted. `` I never heard the words discussed, ` public funds,''' said the first-term Republican who is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is examining a charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> misused state funds by borrowing the $ 80,000 originally raised by his inaugural ball. When state law barred his inaugural committee from using the funds to pay off campaign debts, a `` protocol fund'' was set up instead to promote <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> through events and gifts to visiting dignitaries. The defense contends the fund always remained private money to be used at the governor's discretion. The prosecution says it was clearly transformed into a public fund by an agreement between <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s inaugural chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney. The governor, whose testimony is to continue Monday, said <PERSON> Long </PERSON> told him exactly what to do with the money. `` Mr. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said, ` We have gone through all of this rigamarole and you can spend it for any damn thing that you want,' those were his words, ` except you ca n't spend it for politics or personal living expenses,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> testified. What he used it for, the prosecution contends, was to save his auto dealership from financial disaster. They presented evidence of overdue loans and bounced checks at the car company. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his son insist that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontiac </PERSON> was on sure financial footing and that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s only motive for borrowing the $ 80,000 was to increase the fund by paying higher interest than it was getting in a bank. To evaluate the opposing views, senators were given an education in the car dealership business. At the end of a week in which they examined loan agreements and check receipts and heard about car `` floor planning'' and cars `` sold out of trust,'' the senators who sit as judges and jury appeared perplexed. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, I'm absolutely baffled and confused!'' state Sen. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> at the end of a long discourse on deeds of trust, interest rates and loan agreements. He questioned the extensive `` paper trail'' of checks linking <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> to assorted members of the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> family and an organization called Constituent Communications. Asked what that group was, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 37, who received a $ 15,000 loan from it, said he had no idea except `` I know my uncle <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> controls the checkbook.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, brothers of the governor, were among those who loaned money in a hurry when <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> was asked to pay back the $ 80,000 last Oct. 22. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said the family loans were interest-free and were quickly repaid. He remembered that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON> called and said that `` a political question'' had arisen and the money had to be replaced right away. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could n't remember until he was reminded by a prosecutor what political crisis spurred the Oct. 22 call. That was the day after <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> newspapers broke the story of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s secret $ 350,000 campaign loan from developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>. The charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> concealed that loan is the basis of the next count to be addressed at his impeachment trial and is the subject of felony criminal charges on which the governor and his brother <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> face trial April 21. The first count before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> involved allegations that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to halt an investigation of an alleged death threat by a member of his staff.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> photographer stood trial Saturday on drug smuggling charges and testified that his only crime was being stupid enough to let a cocaine ring dupe him into doing its dirty work. The trial of 23-year-old <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, whose case has drawn the attention of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, began and ended Saturday. The three-judge panel that took testimony for 2 -LCB- hours was n't expected to issue a verdict for about a week. The free-lance photographer from <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is charged with smuggling 4.13 pounds of cocaine into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in a suitcase on March 13, 1987. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON>, a special agent for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, testified that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was tricked by a drug trafficking ring into carrying the cocaine. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, he said, is `` innocent _ or stupid _ but innocent.'' The prosecution is asking for 10 years in prison on contraband charges and on charges <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> violated public health laws that prohibit the transport or sale of dangerous drugs. The defense contends <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> thought the suitcase only contained travel brochures, photographs and film. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a 1986 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a former summer intern in Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office, has spent the past year in <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s 85-year-old Model Prison without possibility of bail. He told the court Saturday that he carried a suitcase to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, an Equadorean-born naturalized American who was living near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> represented himself as one of the owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Sorosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and offered him $ 1,000 to take travel brochure pictures in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> gave him a suitcase to take with him, which he believed to contain the brochures and film. The suitcase contained $ 200,000 in cocaine. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> told the court he had always obeyed the law and acknowledged he had been `` stupid _ but that is not a crime.'' Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Presencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>, who heads a three-member panel hearing the case, refused to admit as evidence testimony about a polygraph test <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> took. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Campa </PERSON>, said the test, administered by a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent, indicates <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was telling the truth when he said he knew nothing about the drug. Federal agents allege <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> is part of a drug ring that moves cocaine from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. On Feb. 5, <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to smuggle drugs in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. He received a two-year suspended sentence after providing information that led to the indictment of three Spaniards and three Bolivians in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal drugs. They remain at large. When <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to sign an annex to a 1970 extradition treaty Feb. 9, he handed over copies of <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>'s testimony to Spanish judicial authorities. Prosecutor <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> called only two witnesses _ the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on duty at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> who discovered the cocaine and the chemist who analyzed the drug as being 84 percent pure cocaine. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, testified for the defense that statements obtained from <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> following the plea-bargain arrangement indicated <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had unwittingly taken the cocaine-laden suitcase to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> -RRB- specifically told us that <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had no knowledge that there was cocaine in the suitcase he carried into <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> airport March 13,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON>, also testifying for the defense, said he became interested in the <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> case because <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> area and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> was investigating a cocaine-smuggling ring that operated out of northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I have found that there is a group of people involved in sending drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> using unsuspecting people as carriers,'' <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON> testified. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> was interested in the details <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had to tell for the conspiracy case we were working on,'' he said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> wore a gray suit and stood with his hands clasped behind his back when addressing the court. He spoke in Spanish with occasional assistance from a court-appointed interpreter. His parents <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, sat directly behind him. His 25-year-old brother <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> was also present. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, as of last month there were 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in jail in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Six are serving prison terms following conviction on drug-related charges, and another eight, not including <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, are awaiting trial. There are no jury trials in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and courts generally take about a week to issue verdicts.

 The 3,200 American soldiers sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on an emergency mission 10 days ago are training up to the last minute before they begin an airlift home, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said Saturday. Maj. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> air base, said the troops were training at four sites throughout this country of 4.5 million people. <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> is about 40 miles northwest of the capital. `` We're just training down to the wire. It's nothing exotic,'' <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said about 6,000 American soldiers currently are stationed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, including the 3,200 from the 82nd Airborne Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>., <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and the 7th Light Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who will begin the trip home Monday President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rushed the soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on March 17 and 18 after Sandinista troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> reportedly entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government billed the current military presence in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> an emergency training exercise meant both as a show of support for <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> and a warning to the leftist Sandinistas against further actions in the region. But the Nicaraguan government denied Sandinista troops were inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and charged that the Americans came to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in order to leave behind weapons and equipment that the Contras could use. <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said Saturday that three auditors from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> were staying at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION>, the headquarters for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, to ensure that the all the equipment brought in by the Americans got back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The equipment includes two <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> tanks, a dozen 105mm howitzers, more than 100 machine guns, several thousand M-16 automatic rifles, mortars and ammunition. `` There will be a full accounting of all ammunition,'' <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said. Tensions rose in the region after the American troops arrived, however, and the Honduran air force said it twice bombed the Bocay border region inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> where Sandinista activity was spotted. <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said Saturday the exercises here, nicknamed `` Golden Pheasant,'' have been productive because they gave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers the opportunity to practice in the field.

 Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> representatives agreed on how to defuse international tensions at a just-ended `` special session'' that marked unparalleled cooperation between the superpowers _ but it was only on paper. The Soviets and Americans were students. They met at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fletcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and Diplomacy in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> conference mock-up. Unlike their diplomatic counterparts at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, they found quick solutions to delicate problems. Take the Gulf War, for instance. It took months last summer for the real <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to draw up a resolution with language acceptable to both superpowers. The two-day mock meeting, which ended Saturday, accomplished the same feat in just hours. The two sides at the mock session also found common ground on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Israeli-occupied territories, issues that have split East and West at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for years. And unlike the normally somber, ponderous affairs at the real <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the simulated meeting also generated laughter, applause and a palpable sense of enthusiasm. `` I think you can get an objective idea of the positions of different countries,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, a 25-year-old from the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on International Relations. `` At the same time, we learn to understand each other.'' The Americans also were enthused. `` It's working beautifully,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Burianek </PERSON>, 25, from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We are really experiencing a great rapport with the Soviets who are here.'' Four Soviet students and four from the <ORGANIZATION> Fletcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> were paired to act out the negotiating and maneuvering of a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting. They joined 22 other students from other colleges and countries to represent the 15 member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviets came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under a program sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> of the privately funded <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> suggested the event had more than symbolic significance because students later would use the lessons they had learned. `` At least on the Soviet side, many of them will be brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Many of the students that are at the school from elsewhere are already in their ministries.'' For <PERSON> Burianek </PERSON>, who wants to join a non-profit international organization after graduation, `` the shaking of hands, the eye contact, the upfront discussion'' will remain as impressions with `` much more educational value that something that's in books.'' <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, who teamed up with <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> student <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> to represent communist <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, said he was most impressed by the cooperation of the U.S.-Soviet teams despite different ideological backgrounds. `` Now I know it's possible to bridge any gap,'' he chuckled. `` Both of us are working very hard for <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> here.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Saturday escorted its 40th convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Followed by merchant vessels from other nations seeking informal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protection against an upsurge in attacks by Iranian gunboats. A procession of as many as nine vessels, including two American warships, three U.S.-flagged tankers and at least four non-U.S. ships, slipped through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and past the Iranian gunboat base at <ORGANIZATION> Abu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nusa </ORGANIZATION> at 11 a.m. local time, where the convoy briefly encountered an Iranian warship that steamed down the majestic line of vessels. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was assigned only to accompany the ships flying the Stars and Stripes. But its presence appeared to suspend for a while the Iranian warship's radio challenges to merchant shipping that often fall victim to Iranian gunboats in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> tanker war. The parade of five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships included two Kuwaiti tankers _ the 290,085-ton <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, a products carrier, and the 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princess </ORGANIZATION> _ and the 39,000 ton MV Courier, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fuel tanker. The escort was provided by this guided missile frigate, making one of the last voyages in the gulf before returning home to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Four unidentified tankers joined the convoy as hitchhikers as it passed through the so-called Silkworm Envelope, a 100-mile stretch of the Hormuz passage where vessels come within the 60-mile range of Silkworm anti-ship missile batteries installed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a year ago but never fired Some of the ships turned off on other courses as they cleared what Comdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieley </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, skipper of the <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, calls the `` Worm Hole.'' As the convoy approached the next perilous stretch, the waters around the <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> base for Iranian gunboats, two more tankers lined up behind the American group. The line of vessels, with <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> in the lead and <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> directly behind it, extended four miles long. <PERSON> Kieley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said it was commonplace for non-U.S. flag tankers to tag along with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> convoys in the narrow strait. `` But it is sometimes hard to tell whether they're actually trying to join us Everybody has to go use the same traffic separation channels in the strait.'' As the convoy neared the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> area, the frigate peeled sharply out of its slot just behind the lead ship, <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, surged ahead at 25 knots and maneuvered into a position to screen the convoy from an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> navy ship, the <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION>, which had turned up in the area.

The Iranian replied: `` This an is Iranian warship. We are in normal patrol in this area of international waters.'' <PERSON> Kieley </PERSON> told him to `` stay clear'' of the convoy. The <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION> held to its passing course, about two miles away. In rapid-fire sequence, an Iranian aircraft also showed up on the radar, approaching <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> from about 48 miles away from the convoy. But the flurry of activity eased as quickly as it had developed. The American warships fell back in line as the <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION> vanished behind. The approaching aircraft were identified as non-hostile. The small boats proved to be fishing craft.

 Police arrested 21 members of a banned peace group who met in a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> apartment Saturday, a spokesman for the group said. <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Czaputowicz </PERSON>, leader of Freedom and Peace, said there had been no attempt to keep the meeting a secret. It was the first time police detained members of the group at such a session, he said.

A municipal official arrived with police at the apartment at about 11 a.m. and declared the meeting illegal, <PERSON> Czaputowicz </PERSON> said. Police detained everyone present, and 17 people remained in custody Saturday night, he said. Opposition activists in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> frequently are detained for up to 48 hours on misdemeanor charges.

 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> applauded Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meeting Saturday with two American members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative body and said, `` He should have met with them long ago.'' Israeli officials angrily charged that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was violating a longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment not to `` recognize or negotiate'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as long as it refuses to acknowledge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` is not violating anything.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> conferred for one hour with the two Palestinian-Americans at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to hear their views on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s latest <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. The two professors, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> stressed that Said and <LOCATION> Lughud </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who did not characterize themselves as <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members. He said the meeting was `` not a negotiation'' but `` a very useful exchange of views'' that represented no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, interviewed at a luncheon of business and government officials at <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he knew Said and <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> personally `` They are very constructive in nature,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` They're American citizens. They're not radicals.'' `` We do n't have any obligation not to meet with Palestinian leaders,'' the former president said. `` The obligation we have is not to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officially and not to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. And Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is not violating any commitment.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` should have met with them long ago'' as part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to arrange Arab-Israeli peace talks. He said he hoped that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s `` belated effort'' will succeed. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal for a preliminary international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> convened by the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan, a joint Jordanian and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation would attend the conference with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> parties. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said such a conference is favored by the leaders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, `` the overwhelming number of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and half the Israelis.'' If such a conference were held, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> predicted, the Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders would be `` very moderate and constructive in their presentation'' because `` it would be their one chance to have the world listening to their best arguments.'' The former president, who has conferred extensively with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> leaders since he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, also endorsed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s call for direct Arab-Israeli peace talks after the international conference, with the aim of finding a way to grant self-rule to the 1.5 Palestinian Arabs living in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said deadlocks in bilateral talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors could be referred to a wider conference for discussion of `` new ideas.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members would be charged with guaranteeing enforcement of any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> settlement and, together with such wealthy nations as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, would help finance the substantial costs of a settlement. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> estimated those costs at about $ 15 billion over five years. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said a peace settlement wo n't be easy to achieve, but he insisted that `` the potential is there'' for accommodations on both sides. He warned that `` it is almost impossible to break down these barriers without a firm and persistent commitment from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and that's what we have been missing for the last seven years'' under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It may be that Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s belated effort will be successful,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` I sincerely hope and pray that it will.''

Principal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the school's dress code allows skirts, but bars shorts and halter tops.

Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the style nowadays is to wear jams at knee level or a little above.

 A life of privilege and promise came to an end Saturday as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> left his comfortable <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home for the city jail to await sentencing for killing a teen-age girl during a Central Park tryst. Shortly after 10 a.m. under gray and rainy skies, the 21-year-old <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and his lawyer rushed past a horde of reporters outside his <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> apartment and sped away in the back of a black limousine. Chambers was processed at <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and then delivered early Saturday afternoon to the hospital at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where he will be held in protective custody until his formal sentencing April 15. Defendants in cases that have received wide publicity are routinely segregated from the city jail's general population and held in the hospital, said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the city <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. After sentencing, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> will be transferred to the state prison system. Chambers reluctantly pleaded guilty Friday to first-degree manslaughter, bringing a surprise end to his murder case. Throughout 10 weeks of trial, he had insisted he killed 18-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> accidentally during a rough sexual encounter in Central Park early on the morning of Aug. 26, 1986. The case, with its elements of fast-lane lives of easy sex, drugs and drink, offered a glimpse into the lifestyle of some of the city's most privileged youth. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a former altar boy and preparatory school graduate, and later a college dropout and drug addict, had been charged with second-degree murder in Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death. But he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter charge Friday evening and admitted he had intended to hurt Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> the night he killed her. The plea, proposed by Chambers' lawyer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>, was part of a deal that included burglary charges against <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and calls for a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. The bargain was justified by the district attorney's office because the jury appeared headed for a deadlock after nine days of deliberations. One of the jurors, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ognibene </PERSON>, expressed `` great relief'' at having the trial over Saturday. `` I'm satisfied,'' said <PERSON> Ognibene </PERSON>, who works for an international banking concern. `` To me it proves the justice system works.''

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Saturday admitted losing ground to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in a major battle in its strategic northeast, and it reopened a deadly duel of the cities by firing two missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, assembled by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, acknowledged <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> had lost land to an Iranian offensive, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims has resulted in 11,500 Iraqi casualties. The battle region is about 80 miles east of the <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oilfields, which produce about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day _ more than half <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s daily output. Despite the losses, the Iraqi command said it was resolved to fight `` with all available weapons'' until <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> agrees to settle the 7 -LCB- - year-old war <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said one Iraqi projectile hit an orphanage and the other roared into a residential neighborhood. It reported seven civilians killed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified military spokesman Saturday as vowing to `` level their -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s -RRB- cities.'' In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships were escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the 18th convoy of the year, part of an operation to protect the Kuwaiti vessels from Iranian attacks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has fired 112 long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, seat of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious hierarchy, in a missile duel that has killed hundreds of civilians. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> says it fired 43 such projectiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and dozens into other <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities since Feb. 29 In the offensive, the Iranian agency said Iranian fighter-bombers attacked <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ground troops Saturday while Iranian Revolutionary Guards thrusted into the <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains. Iranian communiques said Revolutionary Guards advancing into northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have also seized control of the eastern shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>. A hydroelectric dam on the lake provides power for most of the region. The Iranians claim they have killed or wounded 11,500 Iraqis, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200 tanks and armored vehicles since they launched the offensive March 16. They say their troops have moved 10 miles into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, other Iranian warplanes heavily bombarded Iraqi troops around the strategic southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said. It was the third straight day the Iranians have hit that area. An estimated 250,000 Revolutionary Guards and volunteers have massed east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in past weeks for a long-expected offensive. <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported three Iranian warplanes, all U.S.-built F-5s, were shot down as they tried to bomb targets in the embattled <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> province on Saturday. The Iranian news agency reported a Soviet-built Iraqi Sukhoi SU-22 was downed Saturday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also hinted it may have used chemicals weapons that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims killed about 5,000 Iraqi Kurds during the offensive. Many Kurds have long fought the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government for autonomy, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> claimed it had `` liberated'' their communities before the attack. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has the determination and power to use all available weapons to crush the invaders,'' its command council announced Saturday in a veiled response to international condemnation of any use of poison gases. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has said it will send a team of experts to investigate the reported Iraqi use of the weapons, outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed late Friday to send an envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for indirect peace talks with the Iraqis. But a top Iranian official said he was pessimistic about the outcome. In the gulf, the guided missile frigates <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> escorted the 290,085-ton supertanker <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> and the 46,723-ton gas carrier Gas Princess into the gulf. The 35,663-ton Courier, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tanker, was sailing with them. The trip north to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> usually takes about two or three days. The convoys began last July after <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> re-registered 11 of its tankers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the war.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, trying to invigorate a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace plan, met Saturday with two members of a group affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and will travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and four <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries next week to push the initiative. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will arrive in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> April 3 for talks with Israeli leaders and move on to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 8, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We're intensely involved in this process and we're going to continue to push forward to do everything we can,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Asked if there had been any progress in getting other nations' approval of the plan since <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> returned from his last trip, March 5, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> asserted, `` no one has said no; our proposal is still on the table, people are actively and seriously considering it. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s return trip `` will give us a chance to continue to do what it is we've been trying to do, which is to see if we can be helpful in getting this this <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process underway,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> decided to make the trip Friday night after meeting his chief <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> envoy, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, who recently toured the area. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative calls for interim negotiations beginning perhaps by May 1 and eventually more intensive talks designed to return the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to Palestinian control and to assure security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. While none of the countries in the region has rejected the plan outright, they have all expressed dissatisfaction with some of the proposals. One of the stickiest points has been arranging for representatives of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to take part in the talks. The Palestinians want to be represented by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not meet that group and there also is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law against dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has declared a terrorist organization. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought to find representatives who would be acceptable to both sides and include them in a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation to any talks. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, meanwhile, that he rejected pleas by several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to accept the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan because it does not recognize his organization as spokesman for the Palestinians. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> still says ` no' to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, ` no' to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' right to self-determination, ` no' to the Palestinian state, ` no' to the representation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> at this conference,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said `` We say ` no' to this American position.'' In what appeared to be a bow toward the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> invited two American members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s self-described legislative arm _ to an hour-long meeting at the State Department Saturday. Israeli officials denounced the talks as a violation of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment not to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had protested the meeting to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, negotiator on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> problems. The guests, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said they complained to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 111 Arabs have been killed in recent demonstrations. `` One of the major aspects of our interest in seeing Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to relate to him directly as Palestinians our extraordinary unhappiness, our anger at the repressive measures taken by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> told reporters. `` We also made clear to the secretary that all Palestinians regard the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as directly involved in the repression since it is clear to everyone that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and supplies it militarily and economically to an unprecedented degree,'' he said. He and <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> also reiterated the Arab view that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Both <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> and the two <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> members were repeatedly asked by reporters after the meeting if they considered <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s invitation a deviation from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` These gentlemen did not characterize themselves as members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said the meeting did not represent a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and he stressed the fact that the visitors are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. `` This was not a negotiation,'' he said. `` This was a very useful exchange of views as far as the secretary was concerned. The secretary of course explained our proposal and what it is we're trying to accomplish in working with the parties in trying to advance the peace process. The visitors agreed that they were not negotiators or designated representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, they likened the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to a national congress and said it plays an important role in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> decision-making. They also said they had been in contact with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> about the meeting. `` This is probably one of the rare times that the secretary of state in practice is dealing with Palestinians in exile and therefore the message that ought to be understood by this is that there is a Palestinian people, irrespective of location that must be involved in the peace-making process,'' <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON> said. Before heading to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next Sunday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will spend the weekend in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, meeting <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> officials and taking part in Easter celebrations.

 Israeli troops killed two Palestinians in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> clash Saturday and another died of wounds suffered earlier. The Israel-appointed mayor of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> offered to resign in response to a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> demand. The army said nine other Palestinians were wounded by gunfire in clashes on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Israeli officials protested a meeting between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and two officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile Arab reporters in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said troops continued a pattern of overnight arrests in an attempt to choke off demonstrations planned for Palestinian `` Land Day'' on March 30. On that date in 1976, Israeli gunfire killed six Arabs during rioting against the forced purchase of 1,500 acres of Arab-owned land by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. Leaders of the Israeli Arabs called for a general strike to commemorate the day, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> Meanwhile, police closed predominantly <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to vehicles from the occupied territorites. Only local residents, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> personnel and foreigners were allowed to drive in, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV reported. Arab reporters said there were arrests in the <LOCATION> Jabalia </LOCATION>, Nuseirat and Breij refugee camps. The army had no comment on the arrest reports. The army said villagers in <LOCATION> Kafr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thulth </LOCATION>, 28 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, erected roadblocks, burned tires and surrounded an army force, attacking it with metal bars, rocks and bottles. It said troops fired at the crowd after it failed to respond to warning shots, killing two Arabs and wounding others. The Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified the dead as 19-year-old <PERSON> Majed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeb </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, 30. Officials at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 21, of nearby <LOCATION> Zawata </LOCATION> village, died at 4 a.m. of gunshot wounds to his spinal cord and liver suffered on Friday. The army confirmed the death. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military source as saying troops shot <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> while trying to disperse Arabs who blocked the <LOCATION> Nablus-Tulkarm </LOCATION> highway with burning tires. Another Arab was wounded, it said. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 114 Palestinians have been killed since unrest erupted Dec. 8 in territories captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Demonstrators in several occupied cities demanded the resignation of municipal councils, following the lead of a clandestine <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflet calling for Saturday to be `` the day of struggle against municipal councils and appointed village councils.'' The Israeli-appointed <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor, <PERSON> Hamza </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkmani </PERSON>, offered his resignation and expected a reply later in the week, according to knowledgeable municipal officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters marched to the municipal building and demanded the resignation of council members. Troops responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, slogans painted on the walls called for the resignation of municipal council members. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw about 70 youths fling rocks at soldiers and at the muncipal building, which faces the traditional site of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' birth across Manger Square. Troops fired rubber bullets, then warning shots in the air. An Arab reporter said troops used tear gas and rubber bullets in a clash with about 150 young Palestinians who marched through the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> village of Beit Hanoun carrying banners demanding the village council resign. The reporter also said troops forced closure of shops along <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s central <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> el Mukhtar street, which was blocked with rocks and burning tires. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> April 3 to continue campaigning for his <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace plan, which was denounced in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> rejects any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative that does not recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Saturday discussed the plan with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON>, two <LOCATION> Palestinian-American </LOCATION> university professors who belong to the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> declined comment on the meeting. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envisions <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> exchanging land to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> for peace. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> protested that the meeting violated a 13-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to avoid talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> maintains that <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members are not necessarily <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials.

 Black <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, an alleged victim of racial discrimination at the hands of fellow agents, was also victimized by bureaucratic foot-dragging and a possible cover-up by federal criminal investigators looking into the case, his lawyer says. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s story of racial harassment _ portions of which have been upheld by an administrative judge at the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and an adjudication officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ has been widely publicized. Another part of his story that also could prove damaging for the government is how <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s supervisors at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> allegedly failed to aggressively follow up his complaints. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>, declined comment Saturday on the specifics of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s allegations, saying the department is investigating the case. But she did say that `` it is not unusual for any thorough investigation to take'' months to complete. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials says that in early 1986 he was unable to persuade his superiors at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to investigate as a criminal matter death threats he had received from fellow agents. The suit alleges that he received anonymous obscene letters threatening him with mutilation and death and threatening his wife with sexual assault. The suit also charges that a fellow agent forged <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s name on an application for an insurance policy covering death and mutilation. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> also has said he received a picture of a badly beaten black man in his office mail, and that a picture of a monkey or ape was pasted over the faces of his children in a photograph that he kept on his desk. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> has characterized <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s complaints about harassment as `` extremely serious'' and said that racial discrimination `` has absolutely no place in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and will not be tolerated. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> alleges in his suit that he was assured at one point that his complaints were being followed up, but that he soon found out otherwise. In frustration, in April 1986 <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> went outside the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, sending a packet of material concerning alleged racial harassment at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Professional Responsibility. Two months later, the office referred <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s allegations to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division. To determine whether criminal action would be appropriate, the division's criminal section asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to launch a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s claims. The ensuing <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe was `` a paper review,'' <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON>, said in an interview. In a court filing this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conducted 75 interviews in its criminal probe. But <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> says he was told that all of the interviews were conducted last summer following an <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> decision that declared that <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> had indeed been discriminated against when he served in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in 1983 and 1984. `` This investigation it seems clear was a sham from the start,'' <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said. `` They never took the allegations seriously and they never intended to really investigate and only started interviewing people when they faced extreme embarrassment.'' It was n't until last December, the month after <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> referred its evidence in the criminal probe back to the civil rights division. At about that time, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> initiated a grand jury investigation of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s complaints. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s lawsuit says the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> used the criminal probe as a basis to sidetrack two administrative complaints <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> had pending before the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> in connection with alleged discrimination while he was serving at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> got a letter from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official saying that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division did n't want interviews in the administrative proceedings taking place while the criminal investigation was under way. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> suspended action on the administrative <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> matters regarding <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s service in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> FBI office. `` No further action will be taken concerning the processing of your complaints until such time as we are advised to proceed'' by the civil rights division, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official wrote <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> in August 1986. In its court filing this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that `` as a matter of standard business practice, the criminal section -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division -RRB- seeks to ensure the integrity of potential criminal proceedings by requesting that civil investigations be stayed if they relate to the same events that are the subject of the criminal proceedings.'' Court rulings say that certain compulsory statements taken from law enforcement personnel in administrative proceedings could not be used in subsequent criminal proceedings against them.

<HEAD>Attorneys: Evidence In New Jersey Case Will Help Other Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Evidence presented in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> court that cigarette makers were aware up to 40 years ago that smoking might cause cancer and other ailments will lead to a flood of tobacco-liability cases, attorneys said Saturday. The attorneys, including one involved in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> trial, said they expected the documents would lead to the first verdict against a tobacco company in a product-liability case. And now that the documents are a matter of public record, their availability will substantially reduce the cost of pretrial proceedings in other cases, the attorneys said. `` This is a product that is as dangerous as alcohol and as addictive as heroin,'' said Professor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daynard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The evidence shows that.'' The project, which assists attorneys involved in suits against tobacco companies, brought together lawyers involved in more than 100 tobacco liability cases nationwide as part of its fourth anniversary conference. A lawyer for cigarette maker <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the defendants in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case, said <PERSON> Daynard </PERSON> and other attorneys at the conference were taking the documents out of context. The attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, also criticized the group for discussing them while the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was still under way. `` These issues will be decided in the courtroom where they should be decided,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. `` We disagree that there has been proof that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.'' <PERSON> Daynard </PERSON> and others at a Northeastern news conference said past cases blaming smoking for deaths have failed because of insufficient evidence that tobacco companies knew smoking was or possibly was a health hazard. The documents gathered for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> trial include internal tobacco industry memos dating back to 1946 in which researchers for cigarette makers discuss growing evidence of a link between smoking and lung cancer and heart and respiratory problems. They also include verification that cigarette makers developed less dangerous cigarettes, and memos in which the companies are advised that marketing those products would amount to an admission that other cigarettes were dangerous. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an attorney in a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> tobacco-liability case that ended in a mistrial in January, said he hopes to use some of the documents as evidence at the retrial. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsley </PERSON>, a lawyer from <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the tobacco industry. He charged that cigarette makers flouted laws that require manufacturers to warn consumers of hazards or potential hazards of their products. Wall maintained that tobacco industry documents discussing possible health risks were part of industry reviews that contained conflicting opinions. `` I do n't believe these documents are incriminatory in any way,'' he said. `` They show that the industry was concerned about the charges against the product.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, one of the attorneys representing the estate of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> suit against three cigarette makers, said the tobacco industry has a history of funding new studies of the harmful effects of smoking to create the impression that the link between smoking and health problems is inconclusive. `` They did worse than doing nothing,'' he said. `` What they did was a sham.'' The <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> case is expected to go to the jury in May. She died of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of 58 and had smoked for 40 years.

 Angolan forces repelled a South African attack on the southern town of <LOCATION> Cuito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuanavale </LOCATION>, killing 18 black South African soldiers and destroying four tanks, the official Angolan news agency said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified Angolan military source as saying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> used artillery, jet fighters, helicopters and mortars in a drive that began March 18 and lasted until Wednesday. Cuito Cuanavale, 188 miles north of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s border with South African-ruled <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, has been under sporadic attack by South African forces and Angolan rebels since December. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government has said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> were trying to seize the town's air strip to provide them with a staging post for launching attacks further north. Recent news reports said South African forces have moved west and north of <LOCATION> Cuito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuanavale </LOCATION> in an effort to outflank Angolan government forces and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers defending the town. The <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> report, monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, said the South African drive was repelled by government forces who also captured artillery shells, other ammunition and documents. It said 18 black South African soldiers were killed in the latest fighting, but did not specify if they were from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> usually refers to troops from both countries as South Africans.

 Sometimes it's hard to tell who's really on trial in the federal racketeering case against Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six other men. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> are n't on trial _ or even charged with wrongdoing _ but a key prosecution witness spent much of last week telling jurors how he made at least $ 30,000 in illegal campaign contributions to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and helped pay $ 80,000 to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is n't on trial either, but the witness _ former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> _ also testified the company paid an additional $ 800,000 to a close friend and former lawyer of the attorney general `` for his influence with <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' Defense lawyers, in their cross-examination of <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, have hammered at his admitted illegal acts in their effort to prove that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> `` corrupted an entire administration'' and did n't need to bribe <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> for his help. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, his eldest son, his law partner and four others are charged with turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor, into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars to obtain and then hold onto government contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, currently in bankruptcy proceedings, grew from a small machine shop into a $ 100-million-a-year business through a series of no-bid contracts set aside for minority-controlled companies. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> has linked the defendants to numerous payoff and fraud schemes and also admitted personally stealing $ 1.5 million in company funds. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> is among four ex-Wedtech officials cooperating with the government in return for leniency on state and federal charges to which they pleaded guilty. A <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> spokesman branded <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s testimony `` ridiculous,'' and prosecutors have said the senator will testify for the government. The prosecution contends that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> enlisted the help of <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and other politicians to help secure no-bid contracts for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, then extorted millions of dollars in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> stock as a payoff. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 80,000 to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> at the request of the congressman and his wife for `` political favors and political introductions.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> later denied the allegation through a spokesman. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also testified that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 800,000 to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of the attorney general, `` for his influence with <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' According to the witness, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said he had gotten <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, then presidential counselor, to intercede for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in contract negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also said he and another <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> official offered <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> $ 200,000 to fix the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said `` he would take a look and told us we were not going to go to jail,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> testified, adding that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> never got back to them and the money was never paid. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> paid: $ 130,000 to two <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> bankers in early 1984 for helping the company obtain a $ 500,000 cash loan _ at $ 150,000 interest over three months _ from a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> businessman; an additional $ 15,000 to a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> banker <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> banker who helped them launder the $ 500,000 cash; $ 10,000 - $ 15,000 over six years to a a manager at <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, a local utility, `` to have <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> on our side whenever we needed it''; and $ 100,000 to two Teamsters officials in 1985 to settle a dispute with another union The witness will continue his testimony Monday.

 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on Saturday said indirectly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is meddling in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs by trying to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` We urge that through reflection and dialogue it be the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people who determine their political future,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said. He spoke at a news conference after reviewing the situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during two days of talks in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>. Although de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> did not mention the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by name, his references to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were clear. `` We two presidents -LRB- de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are very worried by the present situation, in which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is suffering destabilization,'' he said. `` Of course we condemn any foreign intervention that aims at destabilizing -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB- and interfere in political matters that are the sole concern of the Panamanian people,'' he added. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has frozen all Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, causing a huge cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It has called on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as the commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> accused of drug trafficking and money laundering. In a joint communique issued earlier in the day, the two presidents praised <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and leaders of the U.S.-supported rebel organization known as the Nicaraguan Resistance for agreeing on a cease-fire in their six-year-old war. The two sides reached agreement Thursday during talks at the Nicaraguan border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> for a 60-day cease-fire. During that two-month period, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and rebels are to try to arrange a more permanent truce. `` The two presidents considered it encouraging for the process of pacification in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the developments in matters of democratization, national reconciliation and cease-firing that have taken place recently,'' the joint communique said.

 Green laser fire ripped through the mist and the faithful heard the words they've been waiting to hear. `` If we Republicans can let that future into our hearts ... We can, I am certain, become the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of tomorrow.'' House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who spoke the words, is n't <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, and the laser show at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> does n't equal lightning on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION>. But Republicans are longing to enter the promised land of congressional control. They came to a conference in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to find the key. About 70 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers visited the space center, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and institutes of higher learning that have made <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> a technological haven. After years of being the complainers and nay-sayers on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, they are searching for something they can champion and capture the imagination of the American public. `` You do n't get votes by just saying the Democrats are mean to us,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., who heads a committee working to overcome the Democrats' 255-177 advantage and win the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> back to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Like the desert-wandering Israelites of old, the Republicans have seen an entire generation move on during their exile from power. Not a single current <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member was serving the last time the speaker of the House was a Republican 34 years ago. With their three-day `` Congress of Tomorrow'' conference, which ended Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans launched a campaign to become known as the party of the future. Public investments in technology and education were the themes of the weekend, including meetings with businessman <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, supercomputer scientist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, heart surgeon <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBakey </PERSON>, and workers at an oil refinery. Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> urged Republicans to take the issue of quality education away from the Democrats. `` Americans are really quite Republican and conservative when it comes to education,'' he said, alluding to the back-to-basics movement in the schools. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the only <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> to unseat an incumbent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrat two years ago, said he was working to convince fellow Republicans and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accepted here as the obvious nominee of the party, that a strong space and science plank was needed in the party platform. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., enthusiastically pointed out that at the same time the Republicans were exploring 21st century ideas here, Democratic presidential candidates were campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with a promise of trade protectionism for industrial technologies of the past But as much as they wanted to look toward the future, the Republicans found in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> a healthy dose of the present. Instead of the expected address on his latest heart-surgery breakthroughs, Dr. <PERSON> DeBakey </PERSON> gave the lawmakers a lecture on the need for stray dogs and cats in medical research and asked them to oppose animal rights legislation. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s keynote address at the space center rapped what he called backward looking Democrats and trade protectionists. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> television cameras taped the speech and when lawmakers went later to buy `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'' lapel pins, they said `` made in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'' on the back. The city's oil-bust economy could be viewed only a short walk from the plush conference hotel. Entire neighborhoods seemed nearly vacant, with many houses boarded up and dilapidated. As the police-escorted bus motorcade roared to one of the events, one man held out his upturned hat as though begging for money. A planned outing Saturday to the new <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> performing arts center had to be canceled when police found what they thought was a bomb. It was later discovered the device was harmless. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Special Operations Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> described the object as a pipe about five or six inches long, two inches in diameter, that had caps on both ends. A party was held Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sol </ORGANIZATION>, a mall created to help the Hispanic community but which has been mostly empty and financially troubled. Privately, it was conceded that one Republican leader had questioned whether <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> was the symbol they were seeking. The organizers of the event, which was paid for largely by corporate sponsors, were clearly disappointed that less than half the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans attended. Even the most optimistic lawmakers said it was unlikely the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> could take over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before 1992, when a post-census redistricting could throw many seats their way if the party succeeds in gaining control of key state legislatures. The plight was illustrated by the two fundraisers held during the weekend _ for Republicans bailing out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to seek the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>'s quest to unseat Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is a long shot. And Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>'s campaign for the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> slot held by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, the senior Democrat who is retiring, is even more indicative of the House Republicans' morale troubles. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, 46, is the Republican Whip, which means he would have become party leader after <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> decides to step down. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said his decision to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was mostly because of the opportunity afforded by <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>' retirement and personal reasons. But, he condeded, his decision might have been different. `` If I thought that we had the prospect of having a majority -LRB- in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- next year or in four years, certainly that would be a factor,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said he was optimistic but realistic. `` you win these things one step at a time,'' he said. `` We're ready The question is when.'' All the Republicans were hoping they would n't have to be as patient as indicated by the laser computer-generated image of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> that spoke to them at the space center. `` God speed to you, founding fathers of the 21st century,'' it said.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s personal finances are under investigation to see `` whether there was an unexplained amount of money'' coming to him, a newspaper reported Saturday. The primary purpose of the investigation is to determine whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> derived any benefit, or promise of benefit, from his relationship with his longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> while <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was representing <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the promoters of a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times reported. The inquiry under the supervision of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is comparable to an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` net worth'' examination, conducted in cases in which persons are suspected of not having paid taxes on substantial illicit gains, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The purpose is to see and analyze whether there was an unexplained amount of money coming to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified source familiar with the investigation. However, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said it would be `` the most outrageous thing in the world to draw a negative inference'' about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> because of the type of investigation under way. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said the investigation focuses on transactions made before 1985, when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> invested his funds with <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> financial adviser <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> in what the attorney general described as a limited blind trust. The Times said investigators were looking at how <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> turned <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s investment of about $ 50,000 into $ 95,000 within 18 months, a return exceeding 80 percent. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former lawyer, and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who was introduced to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, were indicted Dec. 22 on federal charges of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct defense contractor based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said there was insufficient evidence to indicate <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was involved in any criminal activity in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has acknowledged intervening with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s request to be sure <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> got `` a fair hearing'' in its effort to win an Army engine contract. Investigators are also scrutinizing <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s moves to arrange a meeting between <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who had been hired by a major financier in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser at the time, the Times said.

 Sobbing elderly women clad in black begged President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> Saturday to help locate hundreds of Greek Cypriots who disappeared during the Turkish invasion of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> 14 years ago. It was <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s first official encounter with the anguished relatives of missing Greek Cypriots since he was elected last month. He assured the families he would do `` everything possible to speed up procedures to end your ordeal.'' More than 2,000 people packed a downtown <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> movie theater for the meeting with <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>. The meeting was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relatives </ORGANIZATION> of the Missing after Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> declared last month there were no Greek Cypriots missing in the Turkish sector of the divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> is a native of Famagusta, a port city that now is part of the Turkish-held eastern zone. Speakers told the meeting there has been no progress in efforts to determine the fate of the 1,619 Greek Cypriots missing since <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in July 1974. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> said it acted to protect Turkish Cypriots after Greek Cypriot militants temporarily seized power from the Cypriot governnment. Turkish Cypriots later declared their zone a republic, but only <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has recognized that move. `` We want to know if our children are dead or alive,'' one woman shouted at the meeting. `` We've been living in anguish for 14 years.'' Many of the missing disappeared after the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> had listed them as prisoners of war in camps in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` There's no doubt the responsibility for determining the fate of your missing loved ones lies with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said. A special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> committee appointed in 1984 to try to trace the Greek Cypriots and 600 Turkish Cypriots also listed as missing has failed to determine what happened to them. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said he will ask <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to make the committee more effective. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> group's failure was `` due to a lack of sincere cooperation by the Turkish side,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Christophos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papachristoforou </PERSON>, a Greek Orthodox priest and president of the relatives committee. `` <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> holds the key ... and our aim must be to find a way to force it to cooperate,'' said <PERSON> Papachristoforou </PERSON>, who has four sons among the missing.

<TEXT>
 The case of a 23-year-old American photographer, tried Saturday on charges of drug smuggling, has hightlighted differences between the legal systems and national customs of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a 1986 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was charged with smuggling more than four pounds of cocaine from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in a false-bottomed suitcase. He received the suitcase from a travel agent near his home in <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Both prosecuting attorney <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON>, who asked for a 10-year jail sentence, and presiding Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Presencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> expressed incredulity that a university graduate would accept a job from a passing acquaintance and agree to carry a suitcase halfway around the world for someone he hardly knew. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the custom is only to do business with people you know. During his year in <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s 85-year-old Model Prison, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he did n't understand why he had not been freed on bail pending trial. Bail was denied because <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was a foreigner caught with a substantial amount of relatively pure cocaine. When <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agents testified Saturday that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had provided them with information leading to a half dozen indictments of members of a suspected cocaine smuggling ring, the judge called it all `` very interesting'' but said he was only interested in <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s case. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> even delivered copies to Spanish judicial authorities of a statement made by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, the man who hired <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, and who early last month received a two-year suspended sentence for narcotics violations from a federal court in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In the statement made in a plea bargain agreement, <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> knew nothing about the drugs and had been used as a carrier. But plea bargaining does not exist in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. In her summary, <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> implied that plea bargaining was a less-than-honorable institution. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials faced a similar problem several years ago when a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> court was considering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Spanish requests for extradition of Colombian cocaine baron <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who was arrested in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in November 1984, was based on extensive testimony obtained through a plea bargin. The Spanish court instead sent <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in July 1986. He went free a week later.

<TEXT>
 An underage World War II soldier dubbed `` the Boy Hero,'' who was decorated for shooting down Japanese aircraft and helping shipmates in two battles, says his age was both a blessing and a curse. At age 12, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was one of this country's youngest war heroes. For his exploits, which will be the subject of a two-hour television movie Sunday night, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. But his youthful looks and a bureaucratic error landed him in the brig and cost him his medals. It took him over 30 years to win back his decorations, and the former gunner, now 58 and a resident of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> suburb, is still seeking disability benefits for his war injuries. The son of sharecroppers, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> left home after his father died in a traffic accident and his mother remarried. He said his stepfather beat him and his brother and then threw them out of their <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> home when they tried to fight back. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> shined shoes and sold newspapers to make money until he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in July 1942, enlisting with the aid of forged papers that claimed he was 17. He was sent to the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for a Pacific tour. Assigned to a 40mm gun crew on the ship's fantail, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> helped shoot down about 300 enemy planes launched from five Japanese aircraft carriers in the battle of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s gunnery officer asked him his age when he congratulated the crew. `` I told him I would be 13 in April,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, according to a story in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Star-Telegram </LOCATION>. `` He was shocked and I knew I had made a mistake. But I was proud of what we had done and I felt like I was 6-foot tall. I did n't care at the time if people knew how old I was. I felt like I had done what I set out to do.'' Later, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> tried to tell the officer he had been kidding, but the boy hero was called before the ship's captain, who told him he would have to go back home. `` He told me it was n't anything to be ashamed of, he had already sent three others back that same day. But I stuck to my story and claimed I was 17,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` Well, you may have wished you took me up on this in the next 24 hours,' `` <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> remembered. `` We were headed for another battle.'' At <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION>, an enemy ship knocked out <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s gun with a 14-inch shell, and he was assigned to help the wounded. The ship later took 47 hits on its superstructure. `` Everyone who was in there that night was either killed or wounded,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` I went up there and there were guys' hands and arms and legs floating around in the water The bloody water was waist-high.'' Exploding shrapnel hit <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> in the mouth but he continued to help medical officers attend to injured crewmen. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> received the Bronze Star for his actions. When his ship returned to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the captain gave him leave to get a notarized letter from his mother permitting him to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> despite his age. But when <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> returned with his letter, he was told instead by an executive officer to turn himself in to naval authorities in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He was sent to the brig at the Naval Air Station in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> for over a month and treated like a deserter because authorities thought he was really 17 and trying to lie about his age. He also had his medals taken away.. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admitted its mistake and released <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> after his 13th birthday, giving him a `` cancellation enlistment'' with honorable conditions But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did not return his medals. Years later, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> enlisted the support of Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and won his honorable discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and reinstatement of his medals. But he is still denied disability benefits for his war injuries. Now confined to a wheelchair and crutches because of injuries he suffered after the war while a legitimate member of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> monitors the status of proposed legislation that could restore his war benefits, corresponds with former shipmates and writes stories of his experiences. He helped write some of the material for `` Too Young the Hero,'' to air on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> was sworn in Saturday for a third five-year term and called on Kenyans to heal the wounds left by the violent election campaign. Thousands of people gathered for the outdoor inauguration ceremony in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s Uhuru Park, and pro-Western <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> told the crowd, `` My government is committed to defending our constitution and to abide by the tenets of democratic rule.'' He made a 30-minute speech after his new and expanded Cabinet of 29 ministers was sworn in. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> also said four people were killed during the campaign, which was marked by frequent street battles between rival political groups. It was the first report of election-related deaths. Most of the violence occurred during the nominating process on Feb. 22 by <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. There were few disturbances during the general election on March 21 and <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> ran unopposed for another term. Some church leaders, lawyers and legislators criticized the system used by <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s party to nominate candidates for the general election. Under the system, party members physically lined up behind candidates' photos or their representatives to be counted, and there were clashes. Critics also denounced the rule that allowed party nominees who won more than 70 percent of their nomination votes to go to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unopposed. About 4.3 million of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s 5.6 million registered voters are listed as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the country's only legal political party. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, 64, referred in his speech to rumors he is seriously ill. `` Many say: <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> is sick I say go on imagining. If anyone is praying for my death, then that is his own business.'' <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> has ruled since the August 1978 death of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s first president, <PERSON> Jomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>, who became head of state after <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1963. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> survived a major crisis in August 1982, when junior air force officers attempted a coup. Two years ago, <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s government cracked down on a Marxist movement called <LOCATION> Mwakenya </LOCATION>. Several international organizations and local lawyers accused the government of human rights violations, including torture, of some of nearly 100 people arrested for alleged links with <PERSON> Mwakenya </PERSON>. About 80 were convicted and jailed. Human rights activists said many were tortured into confessing. The government said 13 people were detained without charge or trial, and that all but three were freed by the time <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> called elections on Feb. 5.

<TEXT>
 About 8,400 gallons of slightly radioactive water leaked into the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the Indian Point No. 2 nuclear power plant, the plant's operator said Saturday. The water was discovered missing from a 345,000-gallon storage tank outside the containment structure, said <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's really a minuscule amount'' that is undetectable, because river water normally contains a small amount of ambient, or background, radiation, said <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON>. The discovery was made Saturday morning, but officials were unsure how long the leak had existed. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the leak posed no health hazard. The radioactivity in the water, he said, was `` about one-tenth of 1 percent of what they would be allowed to release to the river if they did it on purpose'' in a scheduled discharge. The leak in a steam line allowed water from a refueling water storage tank to leak into a non-nuclear boiler and condenser system, then into the river, said <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>. The leak was stopped by closing valves on the line. The incident had no effect on operations at the plant, located roughly 25 miles north of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> line, <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Fourteen of 47 Tanzanians charged with murder in the massacre of government militiamen four years ago have died in prison from various illnesses, a published report said Saturday. Hospital death certificates produced during a court hearing showed the men died of illnesses that included pneumonia, diarrhea and kidney failure at varying times during their imprisonment, the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. The hearing was held Wednesday before High Court Judge <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korosso </PERSON>, who granted a government application for the state to withdraw its cases against the dead men, the newspaper said. The 33 remaining defendants have denied the charges and their trial is continuing. They are accused of ambushing and killing 48 militiamen at <LOCATION> Mwamalole </LOCATION> village in central <LOCATION> Maswa </LOCATION> district on May 23, 1984. The troops were attacked as they prepared an assault on rustlers who had stolen 680 head of cattle and killed a herdsboy. Tanzanians were shocked by the viciousness of the attack. Slashed bodies were found scattered in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and 42 of the militiamen were buried in a mass grave because the bodies could not be identified. Tanzanian courts have a huge backlog. It is not unusual for people to spend more than a year in jail before they are brought to trial.

 Troops loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> raided <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s port area Saturday and cleared it of barricades set up by striking dockworkers. The army threatened force to make the nation's banks reopen. Banks ignored the threats, and dockworkers stayed away from work as part of a general strike called by opposition leaders to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. Troops also raided several flour mills and shut down a union hall. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> announced Friday that soldiers would seize flour from the nation's mills, apparently to distribute it to Panamanians who have been short of food because of the strike. Defiant mill owners retaliated by announcing they were donating the flour to the Roman Catholic church's food program for the needy, but troops began raiding the mills before donations could be made. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwaiben </PERSON>, treasurer of the church's program, said more than 1.3 million pounds of flour stored in the mills apparently had been taken to government warehouses. At the <LOCATION> Harinas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> mill, the general manager, <PERSON> Tirso </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfschoon </PERSON>, his wife and other company employees were arrested. At <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, troops kicked out all the employees and took over the plant. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents got a boost when groups representing 55,000 retirees announced they will join nationwide street demonstrations which the National Civic Crusade has called for Monday. `` We will block the streets of this country. Let the president come and speak to us in the street,'' said retiree <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Escudero </PERSON>. The Crusade is made up of about 200 political parties, professional groups, and student and labor unions. It was formed last June for the sole purpose of forcing out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> through the 15,000-member Defense Forces which he heads. But that control could weaken the longer his soldiers go without pay. Their payday was Friday, but because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s current cash crisis, they did n't receive money. Armed troops raided the capital's port before dawn, moving aside several ship containers that had been blocking the entranceway to the docks since March 14, when the port's 300 workers went out on strike because they had not been paid. A few hours later, the nearby union headquarters was wired shut and scores of workers who had been keeping vigil disappeared. National Port Director General <PERSON> Diomedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> denied reports that some had been arrested. `` The port had to be opened,'' <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> told reporters, adding `` if not, we are aiding the enemy.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> reiterated threats to force banks to hand over an estimated $ 70 million in their vaults so the government could pay its troops. But the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which groups 90 of the 118 Panamanian and foreign banks operating in this country, rejected the request. The government's request `` does not solve the problem of the fiscal and financial crisis of the nation that has deep political roots,'' said a statement by the group. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ran short of cash last month after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration blocked all Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including revenues from the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> _ now in hiding _ as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters in the national legislature ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had been the civilian president, on Feb. 26 after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Since then, street demonstrations and a general strike have failed to push <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power. The strike has shut down more than 90 percent of the nation's industry Cash and food are in short supply. In a decree made public Saturday, the government declared a moratorium on all rent payments. The gesture was a hollow one, since people have not been paying their rents for more than a month because of the cash shortage. Most supermarkets and drug stores remained closed Saturday, defying a warning from the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime the previous day that they would lose their business licences if they did not reopen. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> so far has not been affected by the turmoil.

<HEAD>Vatican Denounces Cancer-Treatment Age Limit in Sweden</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s official newspaper on Saturday denounced as `` tragic and startling'' the decision by a Swedish hospital to set an age limit for radiation treatment of cancer victims. In a front-page editorial, <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> described as anti-human the recent decision by <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s Radiumhemmet cancer clinic to refuse radiation treatment of patients over 70 because it said it lacked sufficient resources. `` Without going into the merits of the technical and financial problems that the state's health service has to confront in very civilized <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, there remains the tragic and startling decision left to the discretion of a head physician,'' the newspaper said. The editorial compared the action to `` the aberration'' of euthanasia and added: `` To let die on a humanitarian pretext such as relief from suffering, or to let die for an opportunistic calculation based on age, are two sides of the same coin.'' It said the Swedish case `` is even more alarming for the bleak greyness of the motivations: Lack of equipment, financial cuts by the state, lack of personnel ... The substance is that the life of a man is no longer the normative worth for a doctor. `` The only criteria for discrimination would be age. Would there then be an age in which life ceases being the most precious gift?'' <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> also commented on abortions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. An editorial said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> hoped that a move in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to prohibit late-term abortions would be the first step toward a complete ban by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on abortions. A bill before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would reduce the time limit for abortions from 28 weeks to 18 weeks. The measure is now in committee.

 Hundreds of thousands of people inundated beaches Saturday as the third day of record heat scorched <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, while authorities guarded against gang violence and brush fires. The noon high of 93 degrees at <LOCATION> Lindbergh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> broke a mark for the day set in 1923. Inland areas of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had highs near 100 degrees. A high of 100 was reported in the desert resort of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where the high of 98 broke the record for the date set in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> blamed northeasterly winds caused by a high pressure system over Western states reversing the usual flow of cooling ocean breezes for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Instead, the hot winds blew out of the desert. Heat records were also set in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, where the reading of 100 in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> broke the record for the date by seven degrees, and a reading of 99 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> topped the record for the date there by 10 degrees. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> forecasters predicted temperatures would drop to the 70s on Sunday as a front brought cooler marine air. In <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, an estimated 50,000 young people on spring break dressed for the weather, wearing `` bathing suits, shorts, tanks tops, as little as possible,'' said police Officer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON>. `` They all seem to hover around the yogurt places and ice cream places. I do n't blame them.'' An estimated 200,000 people swarmed to <PERSON> Zuma </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> beaches to splash in 62-to-64-degree water, but surfers had to make do with 2-foot swells. `` It's just a full-out summer day,'' said lifeguard Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrer </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. By early afternoon, there already had been several rescues, including a person who was taken to a hospital for a possibly serious neck or spine injury, he said. <PERSON> Rohrer </PERSON> estimated there would be up to 50 rescues for the day. `` The only thing that's saving us right now is favorable tide conditions,'' he said. `` If the rips -LRB- riptides -RRB- were pulling a little stronger, we'd probably have well over 100.'' On Friday night, three people were hospitalized after more than 20 gang members got into a scuffle at <LOCATION> Dockweiler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Zuma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies were called in Friday night to quell a fight involving 300 youths The situation was under control Saturday, said <PERSON> Zuma </PERSON> lifeguard <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> DuPont </PERSON>. `` There is a large force of sheriffs -LRB- deputies -RRB- here, and that is a wonderful deterrent,'' he said. Those who opted to stay home and use their air conditioners sent power usage soaring, but not to the record heights reached a day earlier. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> companies said the power drain was less because many businesses were closed for the weekend. Not everyone was relaxing, however. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, city firefighters continued to mop up a 100-acre brushfire near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hodges </LOCATION>, where one firefighter was treated Friday for heat exhaustion. `` We've got a lot of hot spots. If the wind were to spring up, we might lose it,'' said a fire dispatcher who declined to identify herself. `` They're up there practically stomping it out by hand.''

 A businessman was named a special <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> chief Saturday and pledged to unite Indians to regain land they lost after gold was discovered, although some <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> believe he is `` impersonating an Indian.'' `` I promise you I will carry the battle lance of our people ... until the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> are once again ours forever more,'' <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told a crowd of more than 600 people who attended a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Rosebud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who wore fringed buckskins decorated with Indian beadwork, was given a shield and headdress made of imitation eagle feathers and the name Man Who Walks With The Shield. He could not receive real eagle feathers under federal law because he is not an enrolled member of a <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> tribe. The plan to make <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> a special chief to lead the land battle was pushed by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Grey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a group of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> elders, and other traditional-minded Indians. Chieftainships are unrelated to the legal governance of a tribe, which under federal law is done by an elected president and council. At the ceremony, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> smoked a sacred pipe with <ORGANIZATION> Oglala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheyenne </ORGANIZATION> Chief Austin Two Moons of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and other leaders after singing and praying. `` We seek to injure no one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. We only seek the return of lands that are rightfully owned by the Lakota -LRB- <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> -RRB- people,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told reporters. `` They -LRB- the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> -RRB- are sacred to the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> people. They are our altar to God. ... It is like stealing their church,'' he said of the rugged area of western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The federal government signed a treaty in 1868 saying 7.3 million acres of the region belonged to the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION>, but then abrogated the treaty and took the land after gold was found in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> supports a bill that would give the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> over 1 million acres plus money, but says more money is necessary to improve living conditions on reservations where unemployment reaches 85 percent. However, not all <PERSON> Sioux </PERSON> believe <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has earned the right to become a special chief, and a historian said it's an unprecedented title. Some argued <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was not an enrolled member of any <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> tribe and has not substantiated his claim to be a great-grandson of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> warrior Standing Bear. Opponents also said he is splitting the Indian community and could damage efforts to regain the land. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> filed for a temporary restraining order in federal court in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to make <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> prove he is of Indian descent or stop making the claim. The council advises the eight <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> tribal councils on treaty issues. The complaint said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> `` is impersonating an Indian, claiming <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> heritage that is questionable.'' No ruling was expected until sometime this week at the earliest. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said at Saturday's news conference that he had given <PERSON> Sioux </PERSON> leaders an affidavit signed by his father saying Standing Bear was his great-grandfather. Two members of the Standing Bear family appeared at the ceremony Saturday to support <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Another supporter, Homer Whirlwind Soldier, said at the ceremony that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would have the status to negotiate with federal officials for land. `` We send a general in to fight a general, so we give Mr. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> the symbol of authority.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told reporters that he and other <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> chiefs will ask <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> to meet with them and set up a public hearing on the issue. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> acknowledged that only one of the seven tribal councils that support the return of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> has endorsed his proposal and the plan to make him a special chief, but he said a petition signed by <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> indicates he is supported by a majority. `` I think that the will of the people has been neglected by the people elected to do the will of the people,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is an engineer who played a role in development of the Minuteman III before he founded <ORGANIZATION> Ultrasystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in 1969. He recently sold the $ 160 million-a-year engineering company to devote his time to the Black Hills effort. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 58, supports legislation introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, that would return 1.3 million acres of federal land in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> region was deeded to the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION> Treaty of 1868. But after gold was discovered by an expedition led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>, prospectors swarmed in and the treaty was abrogated in 1877. The Indians were forced onto reservations in less desirable parts of the state. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 upheld a settlement for the land, which with interest has grown to nearly $ 200 million. Most of the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> tribal governments have refused the money, saying they want the land. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s bill would return about 1.3 million of the land covered by the original treaty. It applies only to federal land in the area of timbering, mining and tourism, and does not include <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> argues the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> also should get up to $ 3.1 billion for their loss of revenue since the land was taken. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s bill, introduced two years ago and still not out of committee, is opposed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation. Many backers of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s bill say <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' plan to seek additional money would wreck the bill's chances in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Eighth Scientist Dies In Mysterious String</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawmaker called for a government inquiry Saturday after the body of a guided missiles engineer was found inside a car filled with exhaust fumes, the latest in a mysterious string of deaths of British scientists. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 52, who was found dead Friday, was the eighth British scientist involved in defense-related work to die in unusual circumstances since August 1986. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he would ask <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> to order an urgent probe of the deaths and report the findings to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` What is the link between all these?'' <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> asked. `` Is it not surprising what is happening to top scientists? `` Is it simply overwork, or is there something more sinister afoot?'' The government so far has rejected an inquiry, saying there was no evidence to suggest the deaths were linked other than by coincidence. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Saturday that any investigation would have to be done by police on a case-by-case basis. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, who worked in the guided missiles division of the Marconi electronics firm, was found in a car parked in a garage at his home in <LOCATION> Harpenden </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, after he failed to report for work. <LOCATION> Hertfordshire </LOCATION> police said the car was filled with exhaust fumes, but gave no details. Chief Inspector <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON> said, however, that the death was `` not being treated as suspicious,'' a phrase British police use for a suspected suicide. Marconi spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> worked in the guided missiles division of the company's <LOCATION> Stanmore </LOCATION> plant. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> refused comment on the fact that five of the scientists worked for <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION>, a major British defense contractor, or an affiliated company. The string of deaths began Aug. 5, 1986, when <PERSON> Vimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dajibhai </PERSON>, 24, was found dead in a gorge beneath a bridge in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>. The inquest returned an open verdict, meaning there was insufficient evidence to establish a cause of death. <PERSON> Dajibhai </PERSON> was a junior software engineer checking torpedo guidance systems at <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Watford </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The other deaths were: _ <PERSON> Ashhad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shariff </PERSON>, a computer systems analyst working for another <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> unit near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, who was found strangled in October 1986 in a park near <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> An inquest ruled he killed himself by tying one end of a rope to a tree and the other to his neck, then driving off in his car. _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, a computer designer found dead in his <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> home in January 1987 under circumstances police never have explained _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peapell </PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Shrivenham </LOCATION>, who was found dead in February 1987 beneath his car with the engine running and the garage doors shut The coronor's report was inconclusive. _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, who was working on an air defense systems contract for Easams, a <LOCATION> Marconi </LOCATION> affiliate, died in March 1987 when he drove his car loaded with tanks of gasoline into a vacant restaurant _ <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 46, a <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> scientist who died of a drug overdose in April 1987 His wife told an inquest he had been under strain in his job at Marconi Space and Defense Systems in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 23, a lab technician for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, whose body was found Feb. 1 halfway down a cliff at <LOCATION> Boscastle </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Police found a note but have not disclosed its contents.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conceded Saturday that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had won a popular-vote victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential caucuses. `` It looks as if Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has won the popular vote in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference prior to a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democratic fund-raising dinner attended by all the party's presidential contenders `` I congratulate him for that. He ran a good campaign and he has my congratulations,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to categorize the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> loss as a significant setback. `` I do n't think I did very well in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. I think I did reasonably well, but I do n't think I did spectacularly well,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s troubled economy, plagued by auto-industry layoffs, was a factor in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s victory and his own defeat. `` The people of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> have been through a very difficult time,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has campaigned in part on his ability to turn around what was a faltering economy in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` There is great unhappiness, great concern, great uncertainty. There are laid-off workers. Workers today who have jobs are worried they are going to be next. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has strong feelings about that, as I do,'' he said. Although the full <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has not endorsed any candidate, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 72 in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, endorsed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who rallied to them when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was closing down an auto plant there later this year, a move that will cost 5,500 jobs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would campaign hard in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, which holds its primary Tuesday, as well as <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which votes April 5, and then on to later primaries. `` As I said in the beginning of this campaign, it's a marathon,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You've asked me about inevitability. As I have said on more than one occasion, nothing is inevitable about anything in American politics. `` I hope when we finish up in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, I have a lead I can take into the convention... and win the nomination.''

 Protesters opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> marched in major cities Saturday with chants including `` Hey, hey, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, not another <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' and signs reading `` No Contra Aid.'' The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but police in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> had to break up a shoving match between the protesters and counter-demonstrators. The rallies were organized by a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Pledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, which claims 80,000 supporters nationwide. About 1,500 people marched in the rain in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, saying they backed the signing last week of a ceasefire in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> between the leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. `` We have to make it clear to the government that there's no way we're going to go for giving aid to the Contras right now,'' said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Voloshen </PERSON>, a spokewoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> rally. The counter-demonstration was staged by about 30 members of <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, who shouted, `` Peace through strength!'' More than 2,000 demonstrators rallied peacefully in front of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s City Hall as part of the `` national day of emergency protest.'' `` You're strong and you're right,'' city Supervisor <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the cheering crowd, adding that demonstrations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped lead to the end of the Vietnam War. Demonstrators in Civic Center Park across from the City Hall held signs reading `` Stop <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s War,'' `` No Contra Aid,'' and `` Hands Off <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' As the protesters marched cross town to gates of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, their ranks swelled to 5,000, and a few demonstrators lobbed eggs toward police officers at the base gate. The demonstration ended with a rally a short distance away. Police reported no arrests. Police said several people were arrested in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on charges of blocking traffic when they unfurled a banner on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. About 600 demonstrators marched from the Capitol to a rally in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, in front of the White House. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was inside, but it could not be determined if he witnessed the protest. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, about 500 protesters marched through downtown, carrying a mock casket emblazoned with the words `` Bury Contra Aid Forever.'' `` A public message has to be given that this is serious _ the whole effort for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Sister <PERSON> Joellen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a nun who has spent five years in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` It's so important for our national credibility. We preach democracy, and yet we wo n't accept the democratic processes in other countries.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Edgerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said he does not believe <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s warning that the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> poses a long-term threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think it's just a lot of propaganda,'' he said. `` I'm speaking out against an immoral war,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does n't belong in someone else's politics.'' The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> demonstrators chanted slogans including `` Hey, hey, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, not another <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' and `` Cease fire, way to go; <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, this is not your show.'' About 200 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. They chanted anti-administration slogans and carried signs reading `` Peace with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Troops out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' `` End Contra war!'' and `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, how many more Nicaraguan children must you kill.'' About 200 people gathered in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> peace activists just two years ago were pelted with rocks and eggs. `` This is a day to rejoice because at least, and at last, reason has been heard,'' said <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> of the Latin American-Caribbean Solidarity Association.

<HEAD>Guenther Found Guilty On All Counts in Wife's Shooting Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who became the first Coloradoan to cite the state's `` make my day'' law after he shot and killed a neighbor was found guilty Saturday in the unrelated murder of his estranged wife. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, 35, showed little emotion as an <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury found him guilty in the death of his wife and the attempted murder of her friend in March 1987. The jurors had deliberated for three hours. `` It made my day,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, in a reference to an earlier case in which <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> achieved notoriety as the first person to invoke <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s law allowing homeowners to use deadly force against intruders. The law was nicknamed after a line in a <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> film in which a detective invites a criminal to `` make my day'' and give the detective an excuse to shoot. Authorities dropped the charges against <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> in the 1986 shooting death of a neighbor and the wounding of two other people on the basis of that law. He shot the three after his wife got into an argument with them on the Guenthers' front porch. However, a higher court later reversed that ruling, tightening the criteria under which homeowners could claim immunity from prosecution under the law. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> than was acquitted of all charges in the case last fall, basing his argument on self-defense, rather than the `` make my day'' rule. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who called <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> `` a murderer who ca n't keep his story straight'' in closing arguments Saturday, said the guilty verdict `` was supported by the evidence and it was a just verdict.'' Prosecutors said earlier they would not seek the death penalty. Sentencing was set for May. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>'s estranged wife, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>, was killed and a friend, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>, was shot several times outside a restaurant in <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> on March 1, 1987. The Guenthers' two children, ages 11 and 13, witnessed the shootings and testified at their father's trial <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> initially denied any involvement, but later claimed he shot the two because he saw them kissing. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>'s attorneys argued he shot the pair in an `` act of passion'' and without premeditation. Prosecutors maintained the shootings were part of a pattern of threats and violence by <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> against his wife. Testimony showed he had taken Mrs. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> hostage at their home one week before her death, violating a court order to stay away from her. He released her unharmed after a standoff with police that lasted several hours. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> was free on bond from that incident when his wife and <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> were shot.

<HEAD>NATO chief doubts all nuclear weapons will be abolished</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, said in a report published Sunday he doubts that nuclear weapons will be totally abolished. `` I am not optimistic that you can ever get rid of nuclear weapons altogether. I am not sure it would be a good thing anyway, because they are the ultimate deterrent,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Sunday Express weekly. `` I am sure, though, that we can all live at a much lower level of armaments, and one of the reasons I am optimistic is that it is very much in Mr. -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s interests to do that,'' he said. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> will be 69 when he retires from his post with the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in July. He told the Express the West can not disarm on its own, expecting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to do the same. The agreement reached by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at a December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the superpowers to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons and for continued talks on chemical weapons and reducing long-range missiles were originated by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said. He added that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` contrived to let it be thought that all these initiatives are actually his.'' Because of the superiority of Soviet-bloc conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` the idea that you can maintain a deterrent which is obsolete is not an idea which makes any sense,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reportedly Scales Back SDI Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has scaled back its plans to develop a massive space security shield and instead has settled on a far less ambitious immediate goal of protecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in Sunday's editions The newspaper said the department _ five years and $ 12 billion after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched the Strategic Defense Initiative -LRB- SDI -RRB- program _ has abandoned plans to try to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities as well as its military centers from a Soviet attack. The Post quoted senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying that the decision to concentrate on a limited defensive system reflects broad agreement within the administration that the president's dream can not be attained The threat of a ballistic missile attack will not be diminished in the foreseeable future, the officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which did not identify them. The reorientation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s SDI program, also known as Star Wars, was revealed in part by a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> classified document calling for developments and deployment of a defensive system to stop only 30 percent of the nuclear warheads in a massive Soviet first strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The four-page secret document accepted the view of SDI officials that even this limited defense would help deter a Soviet attack, the paper said. However, if this American view turns out to be wrong and the Soviets initiate a massive first strike, the system the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> now envisions may stop only 1,500 nuclear warheads, allowing as many as 3,500 others to penetrate and wreak devestation on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied territory, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said SDI officials believe this limited defensive system could be deployed beginning in 1996 at a cost of up to $ 150 billion in current dollars, double the expense they predicted last year. Many scientists and military experts, however, question whether the defensive weapons being pursued in the SDI program will be able to achieve even the scaled-back goals, the paper said. The Post cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying the Soviets may have sensed the course of internal American decision-making over SDI and predicted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dream would be abandoned, causing them to tone down their public criticism of SDI in recent months and tolerate more aggressive SDI research under a potential new arms pact.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Saturday he bought the posh Plaza Hotel for $ 390 million but he does not plan to put his name on it as he has so many of his other prized buildings, according to a published report. The multimillionaire real estate mogul outbid two other <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate developers who wanted the hotel at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. The new president of the hotel will be <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ivana </PERSON>, who will be paid `` $ 1 a year plus all the dresses she can buy,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, whose other properties include Trump Tower in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and Trump Plaza in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he plans to make the building `` the most luxurious hotel in the world,'' but the name will remain the same, the Times said. `` It's got the most important name in the world and it's going to remain that way,'' he said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he signed a contract for the deal Friday and would take possession in 120 days. The hotel's current owners are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> multimillionaire, and the <ORGANIZATION> Aoki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They took over the hotel three months ago as part of their joint $ 1.5 billion purchase of the Westin hotel chain from the <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he paid $ 210 million for the real estate, including a small apartment house next door to the hotel, and $ 180 million for the hotel and its contents The hotel was built in 1907 along the lines of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> chateau and its first guest was <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>, then the richest man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> overcame a strong showing by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the final weekend of Democratic caucuses to win <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s presidential preference poll Saturday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 629 votes to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 416 with two rural districts left to be counted Saturday and Sunday in the precinct caucuses, which are the first step toward picking 15 of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s national convention delegates Another 467 people voted uncommitted. Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> received 393 votes, followed by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 145 and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> with 130. Other candidates received a total of 57 votes. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had been backed by fellow <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s lone representative in the House. If those results hold up at the state convention next month, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will win five national convention delegates from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will gain three and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> two. Another five delegates would be uncommitted. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, state campaign coordinator for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> voters liked his stands on agriculture and health care issues. The endorsement of Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> also helped, she said. `` We are more than pleased at the super showing <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> has shown in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't see how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can lose the -LRB- Democratic -RRB- nomination,'' she said. `` And I would like to predict he will be elected the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The precinct caucuses elect delegates to attend legislative district conventions, which are held immediately after each caucus is adjourned. The district conventions will elect 1,372 delegates to the state convention, where 15 of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s 20 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> will be selected next month. While people attending the caucuses express preferences for presidential candidates, the delegates to the state convention often label themselves instead on the basis of their sentiment on various state issues, such as agriculture or labor. The outcome, however, does reflect the presidential preferences expressed at the first level of the process, said state party Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaukler </PERSON>. One small town planned to hold its meeting Sunday but the outcome would not affect the overall statewide result.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday that cab drivers, cooks, maids, small business people, farmers and other working men and women shared his dramatic victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s primary-like Democratic presidential caucuses. `` The excitement is when you consider how the common people, workers, men and women, people who want a higher minimum wage, those who want work as an alternative to welfare, they are winning,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference while attending a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> fundraising dinner. `` Cab drivers are winning. Cooks are winning. Maids are winning. Small business people are winning. People who want jobs are winning. Those who want to save their farms are winning.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came in second in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` People are responding to authenticity and message and soul over just money and mechanics,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The only thing that is inevitable tonight is that when we, the working people, stand together, we win and we make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stronger.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has stood with farmers fighting foreclosure, with striking factory workers and with high school students and their parents trying to stop the flow of illegal drugs. `` That Rainbow Coalition of people with whom I have worked has been standing by me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refused to characterize the Democratic race as a two-person contest between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the two men who lead in national convention delegates. `` In my opinion it is a five-person race,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I would not be presumptuous enough to eliminate anyone from the race.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not shy away when a reporter asked him if he might be the front-runner after the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> win. `` I've been there for over a year,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is mounting a strong campaign in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he has been endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72, which represents about 5,000 workers at a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> that is to be closed later this year. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has been endorsed by the union representing striking workers at the <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> meat packing plant in <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION>.

 A Lumbee Indian activist running for judge in his racially troubled county was found shot to death Saturday at his home, officials said. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who had complained to a friend of death threats, was shot three times at point-blank range with a shotgun, Sheriff <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` It just looks like he was actually assassinated,'' the sheriff said, calling it `` one of the worst'' murders he had investigated in his 33 years as a lawman. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> appealed for calm in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where two Indians were charged with holding a newspaper staff hostage in February. He said the state had offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has suffered another tragedy,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> news conference. `` I want to express on ... behalf of the people of the state the grief we share and the sadness for what has happened.'' `` The investigation will leave no stone unturned,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 42, was an attorney in nearby <LOCATION> Pembroke </LOCATION>. He had resigned as director of <ORGANIZATION> Lumbee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which provided legal representation to low-income county residents, to seek a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeship. He was running against District Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> in the May 3 Democratic primary. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> released a statement saying he was `` shocked and dismayed'' at learning of the death. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was found lying face down in the blood-spattered kitchen near a door which had several glass panes broken. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the murderer either forced his way inside or broke the glass, stuck the gun through the opening and fired. A longtime friend who said he had spent several hours with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on Friday said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had been threatened and feared for his life. `` We were looking for this to happen,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, owner of a cabinet shop. `` He knew something could happen _ I wo n't go into it. ... If he had been white he would n't be dead today.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he would n't cooperate with authorities because he did n't trust them <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said he knew nothing about threats against <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was `` liked by all ... he had no enemies that I know of ...,'' the sheriff said. `` It took a very mad person to commit a crime like that.'' Nothing appeared to have been stolen from the house, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we do n't have any motive.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> lived alone. Authorities believe that the shooting occurred between midnight and 6 a.m., the sheriff said. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received a call about the death Saturday morning, said Chief Deputy <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. Authorities received the first word of the death from `` a friend'' of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who would not identify the caller. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> were assisting county investigators. `` We will look into it from the aspect that it could be a potential civil rights violation,'' said <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, in charge of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` He had a real good chance -LRB- to be elected -RRB- ...,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>. `` I do n't think he had any enemies. He was a fine man. He would have been elected. All we want now is a thorough investigation.'' At midafternoon, the body was still in the house, in a rural area about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, as forensic experts combed the scene. The body was later transferred to a hospital morgue in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> and officials said it would be transferred to the state medical examiner's office in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Sunday for autopsy. <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, bordering <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in the southeast corner of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, is the home of The Robesonian newspaper, where two Lumbee Indians were charged with holding the staff hostage Feb. 1. The men charged with hostage-taking, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, said they wanted to call attention to racial injustice and corruption in the county. A letter written by <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> before the hostage incident criticized The Robesonian's coverage of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s announcement for the judgeship. The letter, which was published in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in January, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s story did n't receive as prominent display as did <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s announcement. But Robesonian Editor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said both candidates received front-page display with a photograph. The protesters also cited the death of a black jail inmate in January and the shooting death of an unarmed Indian in November 1986. The Indian was shot by Deputy <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, the sheriff's son, in an incident that a coroner's jury later ruled to be an `` accident and-or self-defense.'' <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s population of 100,000 is 37 percent white, 37 percent Indian and 26 percent black. Blacks and Indians long have alleged racism and corruption in the local criminal justice system. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who is known for the number of death-penalty verdicts he has won, has been a frequent target of the complaints. `` I was shocked and dismayed by the death of Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said in a statement released to the Robesonian on Saturday. `` His murder was so senseless and violent. It is very sad and tragic, and I extend my personal condolences to his family and friends.'' He declined further comment to the newspaper, and there was no answer when telephone calls were placed to his home Saturday evening. Saturday evening, about 100 people gathered at an elementary school outside <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> for a meeting called by various local officials and clergymen in an effort to calm citizens' feelings. The meeting, closed to the press, broke up quietly after about 2 -LCB- hours. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a county commissioner, said he asked for the community to remain calm and let justice take its course. He said participants suggested that the county commission ask the state attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor in the case, and vowed to bring such a proposal to the county group Monday.

Earlier, a crowd of about 60 people, mostly Lumbee Indians, stood outside <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s one-story brick ranch house.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has purchased an additional 475,000 metric tons of federally subsidized wheat for delivery in May, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to pay in-kind bonuses to five grain exporters at an average value of $ 21.95 a ton. The subsidy payments were being made under the Export Enhancement Program, which provides grain companies and others with government-owned crops as bonuses to stimulate overseas sales of American commodities. Since last April, total subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled amore than 10.8 million tons. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified those receiving the bonuses and the amounts of grain involved as <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Artfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons. The sales left 525,000 tons still remaining for the Soviets to purchase under a 2 million ton offer made by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Jan. 29. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also made the Soviets an additional 1 million ton offer on Saturday. The two countries are preparing to negotiate a new long-term grain agreement to replace the one that expires Sept. 30. It calls for the Soviets to buy 9 million metric tons a year, of which 4 million must be wheat and 4 million corn. The rest may be purchased in wheat, corn, soybeans or soybean meal, with every ton of beans or meal counting as two tons of grain. Wheat sales to the Soviets slumped badly in 1986 despite the agreement but picked up against last year as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave that country the green light for purchases under the subsidy program.

 City health officials are ready to begin clinical trials on drugs to treat AIDS victims but are prevented by cumbersome federal policies, the city's chief health officer told a presidential commission on Friday. `` We could do community trials; we'd be happy to. We could get clinical trials with controls going tomorrow,'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Werdegar </PERSON>, director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic. Large-scale clinical trials that could begin at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, community hospitals and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> are prevented by a national cooperative drug trial policy <PERSON> Werdegar </PERSON> called `` lead-footed.'' The national policy is `` unduly long and cumbersome,'' said <PERSON> Werdegar </PERSON>, who estimated the city's 4,514 AIDS patients will increase to as many as 18,000 by 1993. `` As our own projections show only too well, time is of the essence,'' he said. Former Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, who also testified during the second day of the commission's three-day stay in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, urged the panel to eliminate the use of placebo-controlled trials in patients with AIDS where possible. `` Science protocols must not be used to deprive individuals with these fatal conditions of possible relief from suffering,'' <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> told the seven commissioners. She also called for national civil rights legislation barring discrimination in housing, jobs, medical care and insurance coverage against people with AIDS. Despite local ordinances, AIDS patients are still summarily fired from jobs, evicted from apartments and denied insurance when people learn of their conditions, said <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, who left office in January. Cities such as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which has spent $ 50 million since 1981 to fight AIDS _ more per capita than any other city in the nation _ will not be able to keep pace with the epidemic unless federal grants to cities increase, <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, several blocks away at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION>, demonstrators including <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> joined supporters of the city's AIDS-ARC vigil who chained themselves briefly to the doors of the old Federal Building in a protest against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s response to AIDS `` The money that should be used toward an extensive system of education around AIDS and toward development of a national health plan for every single person is going into the war machine,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, which helped organize the demonstration. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. As of Monday, 57,024 cases had been reported to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Of those, 31,836 people have died.

 A contract dispute left more than half the school district's 1,200 teachers speechless, but they taught nonetheless. The teachers proclaimed Thursday a `` day of silent protest,'' during which they would not speak while school was in session. They wrote assignments on blackboards or on overhead projectors and answered questions from students with nods, gestures and notes. `` They had some clever things,'' said <PERSON> Stu </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some teachers made signs that would say, ` Please be quiet,' ` No, you ca n't go to the restroom,' or ` You're goofing off Get back to work.''' `` It's kind of funny, actually,'' said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, 16, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hacienda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` They all gave us tests and a lot of people saw movies. ...

Starting salary is $ 20,265. `` I thought the teachers handled their action satisfactorily,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clonts </PERSON>, assistant district superintendent. `` From what I saw, it did n't seem to have any adverse effects on the students.'' Union officials estimated that between 80 percent and 85 percent of the district's teachers kept their vows of silence, while district officials estimated participation at between 50 percent and 75 percent. The next negotiating session is scheduled for April 8.

<TEXT>
 The U.N.-sponsored <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks went into weekend recess on an upbeat note Friday after word came that the superpowers were softening their positions on key issues. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was said to have dropped its objections to a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> proposal to let <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> play a role in getting the process under way of forming a transitional Afghan government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signaled new flexibility in trying to resolve a second major problem concerning future military aid to parties in the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> war. A Western source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> asked both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to assign high-ranking officials to a new search for a compromise in the aid issue. There was speculation he wanted the co-chairmen of a special U.S.-Soviet working group to concentrate on the problem. That working group was set up at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> this week. They named <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> undersecretary of state for political affairs, and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>, a Soviet vice foreign minister, as co-chairmen. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> told reporters negotiations will resume Monday. He met with both the Pakistani and Afghan delegations after a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the interim government issue was now `` swiftly soluble.'' The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> indicated support for having <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> act in a personal capacity to promote an infra-Afghan dialogue. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> argues that only such a government, replacing the Soviet-backed one headed by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, could oversee implementation of a peace settlement and ensure the safe return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> allies maintained that the question of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future government was not a subject of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks and any attempt to link its formation with the settlement would be interfering with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Last week, the chief Pakistani negotiator, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, indicated a modified position. He told journalists <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> wants signing of a settlement accompanied by an `` all-round commitment to the principle of forming'' such a government. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> might subsequently convene a meeting between the Afghan factions. Originally, according to a Pakistani source, this was also vetoed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The first indication that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had dropped its objections came at <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s Wednesday news conference. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes `` the development through which Mr. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> will, in a personal capacity, be ready to serve as mediator among the contending parties.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in turn seemed to be taking a more flexible stance on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s demand that Soviet military aid to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government cease at the same time as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Islamic, anti-Marxist guerrillas fighting it. The Soviets said that amounted to interfering with relations between two sovereign states bound by international treaties. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suggested in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that both sides agree at least on a temporary freeze on arms assistance `` or on something close to it.'' He said this would ensure stable conditions during the projected withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The secretary said the Soviets `` did not feel they could agree to that,'' but he made plain his hope that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would have second thoughts, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal remains on the table. Special Soviet envoy <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozyrev </PERSON> called on Cordovez Friday, feeding rumors that there was movement in what the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> termed the `` only unresolved issue.''

 Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the influential chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, died Friday, a day after suffering a heart attack while playing golf. He was 60. `` It was very peaceful and he experienced no pain,'' his daughter, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, said in a statement. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for 22 years, collapsed Thursday on a suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> golf course. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, labored for nearly two hours to get the lawmaker breathing on his own. He was then rushed by helicopter to the cardiac unit at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He never regained consciousness. A statement issued by his office said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> died of complications from the heart attack, his third. Funeral Services were scheduled for Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catharine </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION> Reaction to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s death was quick. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said, `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> always said he was inspired by President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to enter public service, and was one of the most effective and loyal supporters that <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and I ever had. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said of Howard: `` He worked hard, played hard, loved his family, his state and his country with a burning intensity.'' Reps. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON>, R-Ark., the two ranking members on the Public Works panel, issued a joint statement saying, `` No person ever has done more to build this nation's backbone, its highway and public transit network, its dams and sewage treatment plants, its airports and its buildings Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said in a statement, `` He was a knowledgeable and effective lawmaker who was, above all, a dedicated public servant.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was known among colleagues as one of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s toughest horse traders. He was an aggressive and agile lawmaker who wielded his considerable clout in an old-fashioned, behind-the-scenes way. He was instrumental in passage of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Clean Water acts, and fought to end ocean pollution and to protect his largely coastal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> district from the ravages of erosion. When stricken on Thursday, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was in the company of one of the literally hundreds of lobbyists seeking to curry favor with his influential committee. The <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Democrat was an avid golfer. He had a fondness for cigarettes and coffee. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> excelled at eyeball-to-eyeball negotiations with other members, using his clout to make deals, or to push his position. Despite his power, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> has sometimes held a tentative grip on his seat. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide of 1980, he won re-election by a margin of only about 2,000 votes over his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challenger. The committee which he headed since 1981 was one of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' least glamorous, but most powerful The panel has jurisdiction over multibillion dollar highway and water projects, as well as the airline and trucking industries. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was criticized for traveling and being entertained on the expense accounts of groups seeking his influence. He was also one of the largest recipients in the House of business-related campaign contributions.

<TEXT>
 British journalist <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>'s fate was still a mystery Friday, the third anniversary of his kidnapping in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by terrorists who have claimed they killed him in 1986. <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> worked for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNWRA </ORGANIZATION>, which marked the third year of his abduction with an appeal for his release. `` We call on those who unjustifiably kidnapped the innocent <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> to let him return to his family immediately,'' said <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallqvist </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION>'s director in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, ignoring the report of his death. <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, 66, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> journalist, was abducted March 25, 1985 while on a writing assignment for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslems </ORGANIZATION> said its members kidnapped <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>. It demanded the release of three Arab guerrillas jailed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in connection with the June 1982 attempt to kill <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Argov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The group claimed it hanged <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> on April 23, 1986, to avenge British support of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Some of the American fighter-bombers that attacked <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> on April 15, 1986, flew from bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the raids, accusing <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadafi </PERSON> of supporting international terrorism. After announcing <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> had been killed, the organization released a video tape purporting to show <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>'s body hanging from a gallows. Those who viewed the 4-minute tape said the victim resembled <ORGANIZATION> UNWRA </ORGANIZATION> photographs of <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>'s colleages said they could not be certain the hanged man was the missing journalist. Twenty-two foreigners, including <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, are still listed as missing after being kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Among them are nine Americans. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday, officials and journalists marked the anniversary of <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>'s abduction with a vigil. `` It pains me deeply to acknowledge that another year has passed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` Despite my frustration at the complete lack of information, we continue to pursue every outlet of information.'' <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, told the group at the U.N. <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> `` the call I received three years ago remains a nightmare today.'' `` I want to know the whereabouts of my husband. The reality is harsh, and despite rumors circulating that he is alive, which confirms my gut reaction, there are no assurances to verify them.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement addressed to the kidnappers: `` <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> is not an oppressor _ he was working on behalf of the dispossessed and homeless when he was taken. `` Claiming to execute <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is pointless _ he is a British citizen working for an international agency.'' `` If <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> is alive, you can gain sympathy and goodwill for your cause by releasing him, now,'' the statement said. `` If he is dead, you can still gain by revealing where he is buried. By staying silent, you gain nothing but the revulsion and contempt of all.''

<HEAD>Applications Submitted For High-speed Rail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four applications to build a bullet train linking <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> were submitted Friday, bringing <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> a step closer to a spage-age, high-speed passenger rail system between its top tourist spots. The applications are to be revealed Monday by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and legislative leaders. After a year's review, the state's <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> expects to narrow the list to three semifinalists and award the franchise in 1991. Planners hope to have the trains running by 1995, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 150th birthday. `` This is a major milestone in this project,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, commission spokeswoman. `` Today's deadline will put us one large step along toward putting high-speed rail in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' The 300-mile, multibillion-dollar project will link <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION>, on the Gulf Coast, and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but the applicants will determine precise routes, financing agreements and which technology to use. The train, which is still being developed, is expected to travel at average speed of 250 mph. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> provides passenger service between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area, about 250 miles apart, but there is no rail service connecting <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> to either city. Tampa is about 85 miles from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The team that wins the franchise will be allowed to develop property for rail stations and connecting attractions, a financing plan that mirrors one used by industrialist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagler </PERSON> when he built a rail line nearly 100 years ago down <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and eventually to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. In theory, the plan will allow the franchise holder to recoup its $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion in startup costs, while fares will support operation and maintenance. The idea has been in the planning for six years. The comission will balance financial arrangements, environmental concerns, growth patterns and technologies, select the best overall plan _ or reject all of them _ and make a recommendation to the governor and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Members of White Paramilitary Group Denounce Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A white-supremacist paramilitary group was denied permission for an outdoor rally Friday, so the members met in a town hall where their leader delivered a fiery denunciation of the government. A magistrate banned the outdoor meeting under security legislation white authorities usually apply to black organizations. The move followed a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's statement that the extremist white group should stop `` intimidatory actions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, whose members wear swastika-like emblems and carry guns at public appearances, said it had expected 4,000 supporters at a stadium in <LOCATION> Randfontein </LOCATION>, about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Hundreds of members packed the town hall in nearby <LOCATION> Krugersdrop </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, the group's leader, condemned President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government for subjecting his group to the same restrictions applied to black anti-apartheid groups. He said the Afrikaner Resistance was being treated like the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the black guerrilla movement seeking to end rule by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white minority. Under the state of emergency in effect since June 12, 1986, outdoor rallies are illegal unless approved by a magistrate or by <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, the law and order minister. The government has been criticized for restricting black gatherings, even funerals or meetings in churches, while allowing <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>'s group to hold rallies for racial division and armed resistance to any political power for blacks. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has tried to discredit the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main opposition, by emphasizing its links with the Afrikaner Resistance, but white voters chose Conservatives in two parliamentary by-elections March 2 and are expected to do so in another at <LOCATION> Randfontein </LOCATION> next week.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors probing accusations of widespread government corruption said Friday that they are examining secret bank accounts belonging to the brother of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Hundreds of students at three universities staged anti-government rallies, with many protesting the alleged corruption. Violent clashes broke out as students hurled rocks and firebombs and fought with riot police. Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-nam </PERSON> said investigators have located secret bank accounts used by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> would be questioned soon about whether he misappropriated funds of the semi-official <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> development movement he once headed. Prosecutor <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-il </PERSON> said officials had seized secret ledgers showing how <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON> and other top Saemaul officials had diverted funds. The ongoing investigation now centers on charges the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> embezzled $ 8 million under a false name to invest in stocks, <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said. `` Considerable progress has been made in the prosecution investigation on <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s alleged embezzlement and receiving of money through influence peddling,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said. A probe into the activities of <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION> movement has revealed widespread corruption, embezzlement and influence peddling. Officials believe huge sums of money, land and other property were embezzled. The Saemaul movement was set up in 1971 to organize rural and urban development and modernization. <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> means `` New Community.'' About 200 Saemaul and government officials have been questioned about diverting funds, selling influence, extorting donations and other crimes, according to the prosecutor-general's office. Prosecutors are investigating charges government officials were involved in corruption or helped to cover it up to protect President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who was named to head <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> while his brother was president, resigned in 1987 after being linked to gangsters. He tried to flee to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last week, but returned Sunday to face questioning. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who took over from the elder <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> on Feb. 25, promised before he was elected in December that his administration would put an end to high-level corruption. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, riot police firing tear gas thwarted an anti-government and anti-U.S. demonstration by about 300 radical students who tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said about 1,000 students clashed with riot police firing tear gas at two separate universities in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> was the scene of a bloody nine-day anti-government insurrection in 1980. At least 191 people were killed and more than 800 others injured in the uprising, the worst in modern South Korean history.

 Seven-year-old <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, cancer-free after receiving the first bone marrow transplant arranged through a computerized donor registry, wrinkled her nose at TV cameras Friday and left no doubt where she'd rather be. `` Home,'' the little girl from <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said from behind a baby-blue face mask during her one-word news conference.

Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said the burned car was inspected March 1 by a private fire investigator and by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Fire Marshal's office, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and one of its unions Preliminary reports show the fire originated in wiring in the wall behind a heater in the luggage compartment of the crew car, she said. `` Rubber insulation became separated from the wiring because of extensive tightening of the plastic straps that were used to bundle the wires. Overheating was caused by the reduced insulation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said. `` The plastic straps began to melt due to the extreme heat, dripping burning globs of plastic on the wooden floor, causing the floor to catch fire. Then the flames proceeded into the body of the car.'' Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> already has taken steps to prevent a recurrence. `` We've disconnected power-source wiring on cars of this type,'' she said. `` We are adding a stainless steel plating to the floors to prevent fire from spreading.'' There were no smoke detectors on the train, but because of the fire, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> began installing them in all crew cars and is considering using them in passenger sleepers. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> did not return a telephone call Friday evening.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Cabinet officer for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said Friday he is exploring a new political structure for the province in an effort to bring peace, possibly based on power sharing between Protestants and Catholics. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> secretary, gave no details but said he would discuss the prospects Tuesday with the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic minority. There was no immediate reaction. Previous attempts at sectarian power sharing have collapsed under opposition from Protestants. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> governs <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> directly from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Protestant political leaders oppose any weakening of British control over the province's affairs. King spoke with reporters after hours of talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> that focused on increasing security cooperation against a common threat, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. A joint statement said both governments condemned the increase of violence <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and urged both Protestants and Catholics to repudiate those responsible. `` They appealed to both communities to repudiate those in their midst who sought to promote the spiral of violence and to do all in their power to bring this violence to an end,'' said the statement issued by the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Office The talks in a heavily guarded <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office marked the first full British-Irish government meeting since Oct. 21, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. Twelve people, including two British soldiers, have been killed since March 6, when British commandos shot dead three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who allegedly were on a bombing mission in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. At the guerrillas' March 16 burial, a Protestant gunman killed three people and wounded 68 at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> cemetery. The meeting was called under the British-Irish Agreement of November 1985, which gave the government of the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> a consultative say in the running of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The ministers agreed to hold further meetings after Easter to include social and economic issues. Among the issues discussed Friday was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s decision to abandon a short-lived policy of not attending <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funerals following the killing of two British soldiers who drove into an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> cortege in <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on March 19. Moderate Catholic leaders, including bishops, had advocated the policy in the hope of avoiding clashes between police and mourners. The soldiers were mobbed, beaten, stripped and then shot when they drove into the funeral of one of the <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> victims, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> man. The <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> delegation `` stressed the continuing importance of ensuring that these and other public occasions should be organized in a sensitive manner,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police said in a statement Friday that two men will appear in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Magistrates Court on Saturday to be formally arraigned on charges of murdering the two British soldiers at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on March 19. Police did not name the two accused men. A private family funeral was held Friday in the central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> county of <LOCATION> Bedfordshire </LOCATION> for one of the slain soldiers, Cpl. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>. His colleague, Cpl. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, was buried Thursday with full military honors. The violence erupted at an already low point in British-Irish relations, chilled by a series of incidents beginning in January when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced it would not prosecute <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> policemen for an alleged `` shoot-to-kill'' policy operated by the mainly Protestant police force in 1982.

<HEAD>West Germans Arrested As Suspected Communist Spies</HEAD>

 Federal police have arrested a number of West Germans suspected of spying for communist countries, security officials said Friday. They were responding to a report in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> that said eight `` high-karat'' agents, including government employees and border policemen, were arrested in raids across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Thursday and Friday. Security officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, were asked about reports that up to 15 people were arrested. One official told The Associated Press: `` That number is too high. It is several, but less than 10.'' The officials said a doctor in the <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION> area was among those arrested, but they did not identify him and would not give additional details. <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, refused comment `` We will explain everything on Monday,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said the raids may have been connected to last week's arrest of <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, a secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> is suspected of being a communist spy for years, according to the prosecutors' office. She worked in the West German chancellory from 1974 to 1977 and later in several ministries. She is being held in investigative custody and no charges have been filed against her. Officials have not said which communist country she allegedly worked for. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s last major espionage scandal, 15 communist agents were arrested or disappeared between August and December 1985. Among them was <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiedge </PERSON>, the chief counter-espionage officer responsible for catching East German agents.

<TEXT>
 A policeman who shot to death a teen-ager carrying what turned out to be a pellet pistol was acquitted Friday of involuntary manslaughter. `` This reassures me how fair the criminal justice system is,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 40. The 19-year veteran was charged in the death of 16-year-old <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, who was felled by a shotgun blast Dec. 31. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said he shot <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> because the teen-ager pointed a pistol at him that appeared to be real. Authorities said <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> had a pellet pistol, a non-lethal gun that uses air pressure to fire small projectiles. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> had been target shooting at cans shortly before he was killed, authorities said. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>' death led <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to pass an ordinance banning the sale of toys that look like firearms. The shooting had also sparked complaints that police are overly rough with blacks. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> was black; <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> is white. The jury of four blacks and eight whites deliberated for eight hours over two days. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the teen-ager's godfather, said of the acquittal: `` Here, there is no justice.'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> was killed at a motel his mother manages after <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> was summoned to check out a report of a man brandishing a pistol. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, testified along with a family friend that her son had dropped the gun and raised his hands in surrender before he was shot, but a passerby told the court the teen-ager pointed the pistol at <LOCATION> Dolan </LOCATION>. `` It was a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said. `` I would give anything if it had n't happened, but it was totally beyond my control.'' <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>'s defense was financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and a half-dozen or more off-duty officers in uniform attended his trial each day. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON>, president of the police association, said <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> acted properly. `` Anytime somebody points a gun at you after he's been told to drop it and does not, your life is in danger,'' he said <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, who has been assigned to desk work since the shooting, said he looks forward to returning to patrol. `` I hope a situation like this never develops again, but on an armed robbery-type call, I will do what I've been trained to do,'' he said.

 _ ABOARD THE USS <PERSON> SAMUEL </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> ROBERTS </PERSON> IN THE <LOCATION> PERSIAN </LOCATION> <LOCATION> GULF </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The cherished traditions of seamen sailing wooden ships `` with a star to steer her by'' are living in close quarters with technicolor technology aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s most modern warships. The interplay is constant between past and present aboard vessels such as this 445-foot frigate patrolling near the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormus </LOCATION> as part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission to protect merchant vessels in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The sounds and practices of yesterday merge imperceptibly with those of today, as the warship monitors the activities of Iranian naval vessels and passes combatants of allied nations on station near <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a staging point for Iranian speed boat attacks against international shipping. Nostalgia has nothing to do with it. Binoculars, barometers and paper navigation charts, every bit as much as the radar screen and computer, play a critical role in keeping this $ 400 million guided missile warship and her 202-member crew on the warrior's edge, ready to fight with a handful of captain's commands. No matter what the crisis, the familiar clang of the ship's polished brass bell sets the rhythm of the day, calmly parceling out the hours of day and night in half-hour increments Eight bells struck every four hours still marks the change of watch even though the sound is now passed via ship intercom. The shrill whistle of the boatswain's pipe echoes as well, alerting the crew to an announcement of importance much as the pipe once orchestrated the actions of yeomen high in the yardarms on clippers rounding the Horn. Technology has its place, to be sure, often hidden deep within the ship where millions of dollars in sophisticated gear work around the clock. One deck beneath the bridge, where lookouts strain to spot `` contacts'' with binoculars and young mates polish brass each morning, the amber, blue and green displays of a computerized combat information center flicker and glow. The command center, geared to `` fight the ship'' into the 21st century, links the ship with `` eye-in-the sky'' surveillance aircraft that track every ship and plane for hundreds of miles. But ships like these, plowing through the best and worst nature has to offer, hold on to what they know best, chary to relinquish what has worked for generations. Says Senior Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Jack'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, the senior enlisted man who has been in the navy for 20 of his 37 years: `` I do n't think you can ever replace the seaman's eye no matter how much technology you have. Instinct is still a man's best defense.'' The systems that are `` up'' today, in the 20th century computer slang, could be `` down'' tomorrow. <LOCATION> SATNAV </LOCATION> _ satellite navigation _ could be off a few crucial miles if the earth orbit has deteriorated. `` I always tell my men that stars and planets never go down,'' observes the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> skipper, Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinew </PERSON>, a detail-oriented leader who prides himself on being ready for anything. `` Venus is always there.'' `` You can walk out on the bridgeway at night and it's like Times Square,'' says the 40-year-old skipper, a native of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Celestial navigation `` was good enough to get them -LRB- explorers -RRB- across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, it's good enough for us.'' On this humid, hazy day, the ship frequently spurns radio communications to use a 1000-watt, 12-inch signal lamp to blink out messages in <LOCATION> Morse </LOCATION> code _ a method in use since before the Titanic. Administrative messages, greetings to captain, words of praise _ all are blinked from one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship to another to keep secure radio channels open for more important communications. `` I take pride in my rating, no doubt about that,'' explains Petty Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, a signalmen first class planning to re-enlist at sea next week after years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a good life, a signalman's life.'' Signalmen often exchange pleasantries of their own between official messages. `` It's great to talk to other country's ships to find out what's going on,'' says First Class Petty Officer <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingery </PERSON>, 40. `` It's the only place on the ship to be afforded that opportunity, we can talk no matter what nation it is.'' Signal flags of yore are flung, as well, just as they did in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' time. Each multicolored flag spells a letter for messages, with certain single letter flags signals specific ships actions. <PERSON> Boatswain </PERSON> mates similarly carry forward the traditions of forefathers on fore decks. Deck lines are wrapped and stowed neatly within several feet of the missile launcher capable of remotely firing harpoon anti-ship and standard anti-aircraft missilers at a moment's notice. Like the men before them, the bosun's mates scrub, chip paint, handle the ship's small boats and use a `` monkey fist'' on a light line to cast a rope over to an adjacent vessel to begin an underway replenishment. The lead-centered woven rope ball has been used almost as long as men have been at sea. The rating today attracts much the same type of sailors it did before. `` I like working outside,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 24, a bosun's mate third class from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>. Now as then, the mates with idle time stage practical jokes on newcomers to the `` Sammy B'' as she is affectionately known A favorite: ordering a rookie on board to the rail to keep an eye out for the `` mail buoy'' _ a fictitious navigational buoy where vessels supposedly pick up their mail bag. `` Sure, we keep'em up there for a while,'' say <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` ` Course a year later, he's doing the same to someone else. And for anyone thinking the tatoo has gone out of fashion in this man's <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, just ask <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, 37 of <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` I would never let anyone put anything on me when I was drunk,'' he says. `` I would at least want to know what was going on.'' A star adorns his left hand. His wife's name, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, wreathes his wrist beneath his watch strap. The phrase `` <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'' in Chinese characters adorns his shoulder, along with his outdated service identification number _ all needled in to his ruddy, freckled skin at Pinkies, a notorious tatoo parlor in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The ship intercom announces the `` smoking lamp is lit,'' which allows smoking by sailors who in previous generations used a constantly lit `` smoking lamp'' to light cigarettes on wind-swept ships. And the `` dog watch'' now as then remains the watch that rotates the starting hour for work details forward by several hours a week. The phrase traces its origins either to the watch during the dog hours of early morning, or `` dodging the watch.'' Like so much in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the language and practices of yesterday blend with the demands of today _ assuring that today's <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will pass it all on to tomorrow's

<HEAD>Dawning Of `Couch-Potato Economy' Good For U.S., Economist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The aging of the baby-boom generation is creating a `` couch-potato economy'' that will be marked by low unemployment, more savings and rising productivity, economists and population experts say. The dawning of a couch-potato economy is the best thing that could happen to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after years of yuppie splurging, says <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, the economist who coined the term. `` Yuppies are slowing down. We're all getting older, a little less frivolous,'' <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, 38, director of economics and fixed-income research for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said this past week. Exhibit No. 1 in <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>'s case is the shift noted last year in consumer-spending priorities after the go-go years of 1985 and 1986. In 1985, the two fastest-growing segments were brokerage and investment fees and audio and video equipment. In 1986, the leaders were boats and recreational vehicles. In 1987, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> seemed to turn suddenly sedentary. Books and maps finished first, followed closely by funeral and burial expenses. The numbers from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may be misleading because the biggest percentage risers are small segments that fluctuate widely, but <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> is convinced that they tell a story. `` I'm not promising you that the transformation definitely happened in'87,'' but something is afoot, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said. He said the shift could point to an increased savings rate. `` And that should leave room for a boom in exports and a boom in capital spending. Which is not a bad mix at all.'' One reason for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s extraordinary success is its high savings rate, which creates a pool of money for investment. Trailing behind the American baby boomers is the `` baby-bust'' generation _ the smaller complement of workers that is entering the work force now. There are too few qualified baby busters to fill all the entry-level jobs. But <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> optimistically sees a positive side to that: It will force business to find ways to automate more, he says, increasing the nation's productivity. <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>'s ideas are supported by others, including <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographics </ORGANIZATION> magazine in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. As baby boomers settle down, they are beginning to put aside money for their children's education and their own retirement, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said But baby boomers will still be spending, too, something that is good news for producers of consumer goods. `` Baby boomers are entering their peak earnings years, so they will be able to spend more and save more at the same time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. In spite of the free-spending reputation of the young, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said, households headed by people aged 35 and over lead their juniors in every broad category of spending except two: alcohol and rented dwellings. The mix of spending is what is changing. Couch potatoes spend less money on movie tickets, more on things like VCRs. And, of course, couches. The changing habits of the nation are more than a myth. The <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> last year reported a poll finding that more than half of people over 30 prefer doing things at home, while more than half of people under 30 prefer doing things outside the home. The median age in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is rising, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> notes, and it has just passed 30. `` Everyone's tired,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 30, editor of the Public Pulse, a <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> newsletter. `` Some peole call it the cocooning phenomenon. Some people call it the couch-potato economy. We think it's mainly exhaustion.''

<TEXT>
 Wall Street analysts are expecting new signals in the next few days of a healthy outlook for the economy. They're not so sure, however, whether the figures will be enough to prop up the stock market after its sharp selloff of late. When the government reports Tuesday on the index of leading economic indicators for February, economists at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> expect it to show an increase of 0.9 percent. Another major brokerage firm, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, is looking for a 1.0 percent rise. Anything in that range would be the best showing for the index, which is designed to measure forces influencing the future course of the economy, since last summer, well before the market crash. Among the 12 components of the index, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> says, building permits are likely to make a strong contribution, rebounding from an `` abnormally low'' level in January. Another indicator already known to be upbeat is the stock market itself, which turned in a good showing last month. For a while at midwinter, worries mounted that the index was foreshadowing a recession with three consecutive monthly declines. That caution light stopped flashing, however, when the decline originally reported for December was revised to show a small gain. Now, if the February figure lives up to its advance billing, fears of an impending business slump will presumably continue to fade. Yet Wall Street, with its traditional perversity, may not find the news reassuring. As the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> observes in its current issue, `` A faster pace for the economy could be a double-edged sword for the market. `` It would support our projections that corporate profits _ based on <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> industrial index _ will climb about 17 percent this year. But it would also fuel fears about increases in interest rates.'' That same reasoning applies to the report on the employment situation for March, which is scheduled to be issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on April 1, when the markets will be closed in observance of Good Friday. The February figures, which showed a much larger-than-expected increase of 531,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, came as a blow to the bond market by quashing hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might ease credit further. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> analysts figure that pace is unsustainable, and are projecting a `` somewhat weak payroll employment gain of 150,000'' for this month. Still, past experience has shown that these data can spring some big surprises. While near-term recession fears were supposedly ebbing in the past week, so were stock prices. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 108.42 points to 1,978.95, for its worst weekly showing so far in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell 6.07 to 146.58; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market 9.04 to 372.54, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index 4.47 to 294.64. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 157.26 million shares a day, against 175.26 million the week before. As bizarre as investors' responses to positive economic news might seem, there is a logical thread that runs through them, especially when you consider that the market's biggest concern is not the known present but the unknown future. Most economists agree that employment figures are a `` coincident'' indicator _ in other words, a rise in employment now is no reliable indication of better business conditions later on. The leading indicators, similarly, are old news for the market in the sense that they partly reflect what stock prices themselves were doing several weeks ago. The chief concern about economic strength is that it may be setting the stage for a tighter credit policy, increasing inflationary pressures, and other forces that might bring on a recession six months or even a year from now.

Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> took a sharp drop for the second straight session. In its worst week so far in 1988, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 1,978.95, down 44.92 points from Thursday and 108.42 points for the week. A <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman would not comment on the rumors, nor would a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, rumored on Wall Street to be planning to pay $ 60 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> in an acquisition. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 3 to 88 -LCB-. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not heard any conversations concerning his company and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't know anything about it, but our policy is we do n't comment on acquisition rumors,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON> said `` we do n't comment on rumors.'' Asked to explain why <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock was up Friday on a generally bearish market, he said, `` we also have no comment on stock market activities.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a tobacco and beverage analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he had heard the rumors but doubted their validity. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Management has been saying all along that they are n't in the market for a large acquisition,'' he said. `` They just announced a small one. But this would cost them $ 7 billion, if they paid $ 60 a share for it. And I'm not sure they are willing to make another acquisition until they get General Foods going.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> acquired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> in November 1985, he said. `` All you hear is rumors,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohenm </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's all over the place but I have no way of knowing if there are any transactions taking place.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm which controls about 6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, announced last month it was approaching potential buyers of the Boston-based company and might take other moves to boost <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s share price. Last month <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> nominated four candidates for the seats available on the 12-member board of directors at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting April 21. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Colman </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> responded by asking stockholders not to sign proxy cards being distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> soliciting support in the elections. Earlier this month, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was granted a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> waiver of the standard waiting period for acquiring large blocks of stock and was allowed to purchase up to 24.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns about 400,000 shares, which was less than three-tenths of 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s 115 million common shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> underwent a major restructuring after rebuffing a third hostile takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, which agreed not to seek to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> under a 10-year pact signed in November 1986. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the rumored takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has been around for days and added that it makes no sense. `` It's another cash cow. It's in the razor blade business. That's not exactly a growth industry,'' said <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who follows <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` I ca n't pronounce the name, but there's also rumors that a Japanese pharmaceutical company is interested.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the flurry of rumors riddling the market is a sign of another fall. `` They pushed up all these stocks the last time on disingenuous rumors. They just pumped all these stocks and then the market fell 500 points.''

<HEAD>Roper Board Will Meet On GE, Whirlpool Offers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its board will meet next week to review <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 507 million tender offer and the $ 470 million acquisition agreement it has with <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A meeting date was not set, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s board of directors to confirm its March 18 recommendation that <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> shareholders accept <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 50-a-share offer The board said earlier this week it would consider <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s sweetened $ 54-a-share offer. GE, meanwhile, said it would move its federal court action in the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> acquisition struggle to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> after a judge in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> rejected its request to move a related lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` It was simply a matter of whether it would be consolidated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, headquarters <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will withdraw the federal suit it filed in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and refile it in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON>'s court in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> will be inconvenienced by litigating in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will be inconvenienced by litigating in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> said in a written order Thursday, but he noted many of the main witnesses are in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. GE raised its per-share offering from $ 45 to $ 54 for the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, Ga.-based appliance and lawn equipment maker after <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> board's ecommended that shareholders accept the $ 50-a-share bid from <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> has not said whether it will respond with another increase. `` We do n't have a comment on that at this point,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said Friday. Analysts said merging with <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> would move <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> ahead of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's top appliance maker. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s federal court suit charged that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s initial offer for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> was an attempt to sabotage a Whirlpool-Roper merger agreement announced in February, in which <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 37.50 a share. In its lawsuits, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> failed to adequately disclose terms of their merger agreement under <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> laws and failed to publicly disclose a prior interest by GE in acquiring <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Post Solid Gains; WTI Breaks $17-a-Barrel Level</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for SATURDAY PMs</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The oil market has ended the week on a firm note, with crude prices rising above the psychologically important $ 17-a-barrel mark for the first time since mid-February. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intemediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled at $ 17.03 per barrel Friday. That was 7 cents higher than Thursday's close. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the April contract for wholesale heating oil rose 0.38 cent to 47.78 cents per gallon, after slipping 0.33 cent Thursday. Unleaded gasoline, up 0.08 cent Thursday, rose 0.61 cent to 47.94 cents a gallon. Traders attributed the increase to speculation that the five-member pricing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would take substantive action to stabilize prices when it meets the first week in April. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> had announced plans to hold the meeting earlier this week. Analysts, though, expressed doubts over whether anything would be accomplished prior to the cartel's regular meeting in June Still, `` the marketplace is telling us it's afraid of selling,'' explained <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, a senior trader with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was very strong trade buying.'' Oil prices have fallen recently amid allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states were cheating on production levels as well as pricing rules.
