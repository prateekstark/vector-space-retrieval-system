<HEAD>26 Sinhalese Militants Surrender</HEAD>

 The government on Wednesday declared a week-long cease-fire with Sinhalese and Tamil rebels, and an official said 26 Sinhalese militants surrendered under President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s peace plan. The militants, belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, gave themselves up at temples and government offices Wednesday, said the military official, who can not be identified under briefing rules. He did not give details. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, seeking to end six years of ethnic violence that has claimed 12,500 lives, announced a general amnesty and unilateral cease-fire to Sinhalese and Tamil rebels. The offer was part of a peace package that included seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and jobs for the militants. The cease-fire began a day before Sinhalese and Tamils celebrate a common new year. The government also set up 228 centers at schools, temples and government offices across the country where the rebels could give themselves up. The front has not yet responded to the truce offer but the largest Tamil militant group, campaigning to set up an independent state in Northern and Northeastern Provinces, rejected it outright Tuesday. However, `` the militants have a week to surrender and it is too early to make a decision about the response to the surrender call,'' the military official said. No militants surrendered in the capital. The chief priest of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said `` nobody turned up'' at the shrines where reception centers were set up for receiving the rebels. An official at a reception center in <LOCATION> Weligama </LOCATION>, 85 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said on the telephone: `` We have a whole lot of armed police here but nobody to surrender.'' The south is the Sinhalese heartland where the Marxist rebels are most active. The extremists have been blamed for more than 2,500 political killings since January and most of the victims have been government officials and security men. The militants have been trying to topple the government since July 1987 when it signed a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil separatist campaign. The left-wing extremists say the accord gave the minority Tamils too many concessions. They also say the presence of Indian troops, deployed to disarm the Tamil rebels and enforce the 1987 accord, compromises the country's independence. An Indian High Commission or embassy offical said <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> troops will continue to carry out operations against the Tamil rebels. But the troops will not hinder the `` process of surrendering,'' said the offical who can not be identified under briefing rules. The dominant Tamil rebel group, <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday: `` We will not agree to any cease-fire so long as the Indian army remains in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the conflict because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. Tamil militants launched a campaign in 1983 for an independent homeland, citing discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in employment and education. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Most live in the Northern and <LOCATION> Northeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Provinces </LOCATION>, where they want their homeland. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's population and control the government and military

 Moslem guerrillas fired rockets and heavy artillery into the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, but Afghan troops returned fire and forced the guerrillas to retreat, a government spokesman said Wednesday. Also Wednesday, Iran-based guerrilla leaders were quoted as saying plans were under way for an offensive near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance leader, <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, said the resistance plans to shift its interim government this week from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to the `` liberated'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> provinces of <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, foreign minister of the interim government set up in February by several guerrilla groups, told a news conference Wednesday that the entire Cabinet would move within the `` next two to three days,'' some ministries to <LOCATION> Asadabad </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION>, and others to a site still be decided in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> on an eight-nation tour to seek recognition for his government. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> announced Tuesday if will formally recognize the interim government. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, spokesman of the Iran-based guerrillas, said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that `` forces in the city of <LOCATION> Meidan </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and in <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> and areas to the north of the capital are preparing to start operations, and soon a new front will be opened near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. The guerrillas are split into the Iran-based Shiite coalition and the larger Sunni alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The two have been at odds over the formation of a guerrilla government, in which the Shiite alliance is not represented. An unidentified official of the Shiite alliance was quoted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying that `` plans to attack <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have been drawn up and efforts are under way to unite all mujahedeen groups for delivering the coup de grace.'' Pakistan-based guerrilla groups have been engaged in heavy fighting for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> since March 6. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 19 civilians died and 15 were wounded in the latest rebel attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 45 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Government forces counterattacked and forced the opposition to halt their offensive and retreat,'' he said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said there were no casualties among government soldiers. He said 271 guerrillas were killed and 201 were injured. The information could not be independently confirmed. The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. Capturing <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is considered a key element in their strategy because it would give the guerrillas their first major urban foothold. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints will be set up at six points along the Afghan-Pakistani border to check for aid <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> alleges is flowing to the guerrillas illegally from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed Tuesday to allow the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to set up permanent monitoring posts along the border. It denies the Afghan allegations. The checkpoints will be manned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which monitored the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said the Iran-based forces oppose the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> deployment. <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, prime minister of the rebels' provisional government, told <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Wednesday to stay clear of what he called a dying <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's desperate tactic to draw the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> into a domestic war. In a letter, he asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief to pre-empt a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> debate and if that was not possible, then to `` steer the debate on the right course _ <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling Marxists charged in an emergency session of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was waging a `` full-fledged war'' against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and intervening in the war by sending Pakistani army and milita to the battlefront. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denied these charges, which have repeatedly been leveled by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government.

 Authorities found 12 male bodies in graves at a ranch just south of the Mexican border Tuesday and said the victims were sacrificed by a satanic cult of drug smugglers. `` It was horrible,'' <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told a news conference in this border city. `` It was like a human slaughterhouse.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> arrested four people, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said the suspects were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican citizens, but did not identify them further. The dead found by the federal police included 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, who vanished during his spring break last month while in the Mexican city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> apparently was chosen at random by drug smugglers who hoped human sacrifices would protect them from harm, <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said. He was taken after the cult members `` were told to pick one <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> male that particular night,'' the lieutenant said. The cult had been involved in human sacrifices for about nine months, he said, and prayed to the devil `` so the police would not arrest them, so bullets would not kill them and so they could make more money.'' Authorities found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones, said <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. A small color snapshot displayed at the news conference showed a caldron containing a dark, red liquid and what appeared to be bones. Another picture showed 12 body bags. Authorities would not identify the other victims, but said all were males. One grave held three bodies another contained two, said Neck. Some victims were shot in the head, while others appeared to have been slain with machetes or sledgehammers, the agent said. The bodies were found Tuesday morning in a field about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said. `` I've been an investigator 15 years and it's one of the worst things I've ever seen,'' he said. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s brain was missing, said <ORGANIZATION> Brownsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, who said he saw the body at a <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> funeral home. `` There was nothing inside the skull,'' <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> said. In some forms of witchcraft, removal of the brain signifies a sacrifice of the victim's soul. <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s legs were cut off at mid-calf and his spine was severed and twisted. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a pre-medical student, vanished from a crowded <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> street shortly after 2 a.m. on March 14 while on a drinking foray with a group of friends in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, a city of 180,000 just across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Law officers on both sides of the border were stumped, with no clues to <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s disappearance despite an intensive search, the questioning of nearly 100 people and a $ 15,000 reward. The 3-foot-deep grave containing <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s body was found after Mexican federal police alerted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials early Tuesday that they had obtained confessions from the suspects, officials said. At least one of the suspects admitted involvement in <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s death, said Neck The student's parents, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> on Tuesday following the grisly discovery. <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, the mother of one of the students with <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> the night he vanished, took the <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION> to the airport for the trip. `` <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> -RRB- of course is very upset after finding out the news that it really was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> down there,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> KTRK-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> later. `` They went down there in hopes that it would n't be, but it did n't turn out that way.'' Authorities refused to talk about the evidence or pinpoint the location of the grave. The area was sealed, <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said. The case is being investigated by Customs, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General's Office, Mexican federal authorities and local law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border. It was the third drug-related mass killing discovered near the border in less than three weeks. On March 29, Mexican authorities found the bodies of three women and six men on an abandoned ranch near <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Five were at the bottom of a well and four in an earthen septic tank All nine were bound and had been tortured and mutilated, officials said. Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said the slayings were drug-related. On April 1, the bodies of three more men killed in similar fashion were fished from the well. All were believed to be Mexican nationals. On March 27, two people from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and three from the Mexican state of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> were found bound and stabbed in a shed in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. Those deaths were also called drug-related. Officials said Thursday it was possible the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> cases were linked. Herbal medicine and the use of witch doctors, or `` curanderos,'' is common in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Most markets in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have stalls where herbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or bad spells or to cleanse a home of evil. Human sacrifice, common in the country's pre-Columbian Indian cultures, is little known now, but is not unheard of. It is said to be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is killed as part of curing another. One such case was reported earlier this year in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Imagine <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> or <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> not allowing songs from their latest musicals to be recorded or played on the radio or performed in nightclubs and cabarets. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> issued such an edict after the opening of `` Sitting Pretty,'' his 1924 musical written with <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> and P.G. <PERSON> Wodehouse </PERSON>. Why the ban? <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> was a man who wanted his music played the way he wrote it and not jazzed up or distorted by popular renditions. He was a perfectionist, although some musical comedy historians think the prohibition may have been a ploy by <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> to create more interest in the show. If it was, it did n't work. Despite generally good reviews, the musical had a disappointing run of only 95 performances and promptly was forgotten. Eiht or nine of its songs were published, but much of the score disappeared until it was unearthed in a <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, warehouse seven years ago. Now `` Sitting Pretty'' returns to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for five performances in a concert version at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- April 13 through April 16 -RRB-. It will be conducted by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON>, the man behind the recent complete and critically praised recording of `` Show Boat.'' The concerts, performed with a 23-piece orchestra and an 18-member cast, star <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Graae </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Criswell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. For <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON>, `` Sitting Pretty'' is a labor of love, a chance to perform a musical not heard in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for 65 years. `` Nobody knows the score at all,'' said <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON> who considers the work an important transition piece, a bridge between <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s less serious, early musicals and his masterpiece, `` Show Boat. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who orchestrated many of <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s musicals, would sometimes refer to ` Sitting Pretty' in interviews, saying that it was something that people someday should hear again because it was special,'' he said <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON> first heard the music in 1980 when <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> let <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON> raid his sheet music collection. `` It was so different and so beautiful, and on an emotional plane so far removed from many of the other things <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> was writing at the time,'' he said. `` This score has the deepest emotional depth of anything he wrote until ` Show Boat.' `` I do n't know what part of himself <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> dug down into to create this score, and I should say <PERSON> Wodehouse </PERSON> did as well because the lyrics are as moving and emotional as a lot of the music.'' The creators did n't get it from the frivolous plot, concocted by <PERSON> Wodehouse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, which involves twin orphans who fall in love with the real and adopted sons of a wealthy old man. `` It's extraordinary because there is this wild dichotomy between the book and parts of the score which are really emotional _ songs like ` There Is n't One Girl,' ` A Year From Today' and ` The Magic Train.' It's the real thing. When the music starts, playtime stops,'' <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON> said. `` I think it comes from the fact that <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, by 1924, was ready to flex his muscles. And when he saw opportunities to write truly emotional music, he went for it.'' `` Sitting Pretty'' remained unperformable until the <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> discovery where a full score for the show as well as a lot of <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s working sketches were found. The Carnegie concerts will also include 95 percent of the show's dialogue <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON> discovered a late draft of the script in the Museum of the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Between that script, an early copy filed at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the full scores found in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, he was able to piece together a book for the performers to use. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> has been a major preoccupation of <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON>'s for a long time. In 1985, he did concert versions at Carnegie of <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s `` Oh, Boy!,'' `` Oh, Lady! Lady!!'' and `` Zip! Goes a Million.'' Besides `` Show Boat,'' <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON> has a recording of Kern overtures, including `` Sitting Pretty,'' coming out in May on EMI-Angel. He also has a complete version of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Anything Goes'' waiting for release on the same label His other upcoming projects include new recordings of <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>'' and possibly <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>'s `` Annie Get Your Gun.'' For the moment, though, he's concentrating on <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> and the concert version of `` Sitting Pretty.'' Musical comedy buffs will savor one number in particular, the title song. It was dropped a week into the musical's original run because leading man <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> had a minor speech impediment. When <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> sang, `` I like to sit, just sit and sit and sit, with you the whole day through,'' it sounded, according to <LOCATION> Kern </LOCATION> biographer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordman </PERSON> `` embarrassingly different.'' <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON>'s concerts should rescue the song

 A group of middle-class men, concerned that friends were dying and nothing was being done, met in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> eight years ago. They called themselves Gay Men's Health Crisis. They had little money and less clout; there was no name for the disease that brought them together. Today, Gay Men's Health Crisis has a $ 10 million budget, its own six-story <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building and 2,000 volunteers, and the disease has a name: acquired immune deficiency syndrome. After years of hectoring politicians and public health officials to address the problems of people with AIDS, <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> and its cohorts are themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face of that population. Nationwide, more than 87,000 cases of AIDS have been reported, about two-thirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men. But in many cities, especially along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, someone diagnosed with AIDS today is about as likely to have become infected by shooting up with dirty needles as through sex. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, intravenous drug abusers comprised an estimated 45 percent of all newly reported AIDS cases last year. `` These projections bear out what we have long known, that the spread of AIDS is fueled by drugs -LRB- and -RRB- that AIDS is accelerating its onslaught upon poor, drug-ravaged neighborhoods and minority communities,'' said city Health Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, IV drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new AIDS cases. What this means to AIDS-service providers is only now being addressed. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, with the most people with AIDS per capita of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city, wins praise from all quarters for its response to the epidemic. Its Shanti Project, a peer-counseling group for the terminally ill, had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct. Now it has a $ 3 million budget and a paid staff of 70, directing counseling groups and a housing program geared toward independent living for people with AIDS. But <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON>'s education director, notes that about 96 percent of AIDS cases in the city are among gay males `` who used to lead relatively normal lives,'' were employed full time and have a firmer footing in society. `` I think that because the impact of AIDS has been primarily, overwhelmingly, on the gay community thus far, we have succeeded so far in developing our resources along with the epidemic,'' he said. `` We do n't have the answers yet on how to best serve the IV drug-user population.'' The situation is similar in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, and other cities where the number of IV drug users is relatively small, experts say. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, things are more difficult. `` What we're dealing with here in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, particularly when we're dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution, is not the gay community, but blacks, minorities, IV drug users, prostitutes and their families _ people of the streets basically,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Mascia </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> and Immigrants Aid, a private group that helps house homeless people with AIDS. `` While we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some of the models that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has, we're talking about working with a different population for the most part,'' <PERSON> Mascia </PERSON> said. Part of the problem is that an IV drug user does not automatically kick the habit when diagnosed with AIDS. But most AIDS organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatment before they are accepted as clients. `` It's fine for us to deal with you as someone with ARC -LRB- AIDS-related condition -RRB- or AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> deputy director for policy. `` But the truth is if you're just leaving our front door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm, we're really not doing you any big favor. `` You've got two illnesses to be dealt with.'' Programs such as <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> and the Shanti Project depend on volunteers, but <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said, `` We are finding now that ... the volunteer model really does n't work with them. They need much more direct, intense case management, much more involvement, usually by a professional staff person to help them set up the structure of their life, so that they're independent.'' The drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless, yet shelters are no place for someone infected with AIDS. Several cities run apartments for people with AIDS capable of independent living, but demand far outstrips supply. People with AIDS who no longer need hospitalization but have no place to go often are sent to single-room-occupancy hotels, where they have no medical supervision and must contend with seedy surroundings and crime. Many are `` discharged from the hospital and can sit on the bench out front,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> of Lifelink, a Washington-based AIDS organization. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a lucky few find room in the highly praised, privately run <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the city's only supervised AIDS residence. It opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes to add nine more rooms by the summer of 1990. For <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>, 38, a 20-year heroin and cocaine addict diagnosed with AIDS about two years ago, a clean, nicely furnished room at <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a treatment program `` was the only thing that saved me.'' Yet even <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has evicted several residents because of drug-related problems, said its administrator, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>. `` We consider ourselves a humane society, and I do n't think we should doubly punish a person who's already suffering,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless board. `` I would be hard pressed to make the argument that every single program has to accept people who ... ` go off the wagon.' Perhaps what we need, maybe, is a house in a community where people who can not stop have a place to go.'' <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> also wants to see a range of services targeted at specific populations, but <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said his organization, despite its position as the nation's largest private AIDS-service organization, ca n't be expected to be all things to all people. Gay and bisexual men still make up 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION>'s caseload of 2,500 HIV-infected people, and `` just taking care of that burden alone is extremely daunting,'' he said. Some former volunteers and other AIDS activists have criticized <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> for, among other things, not sharing more of its resources with smaller groups, but <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to appear arrogant. `` We're real conscious of our limitations. We believe in empowerment. We believe in communities taking care of themselves and getting the resources and asserting their own leadership ... `` The future is to get a bigger pie and to get other people involved with the disease ... A lot of the policy and advocacy work that we're doing is around this issue of budgets and getting money out to communities who do n't have the access and the political organizing skills that we do ... `` I think we are around for a much longer fight than maybe some people anticipated.''

<TEXT>
 Air and water pollution have reached crisis proportions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and Western experts sy pollutants are taking a heavy toll in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as far as the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. West German officials are considering an offer of money and technology to help the East German communist government clean it up. `` The water quality of the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is particularly critical when it reaches <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Huthmacher </PERSON>, a spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` Air pollution has also reached dangerous levels.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ecological group's West German branch said the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> carries wastes to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where `` plant and animal life are seriously threatened and destroyed.'' It also said human health is also increasingly at risk from contaminated drinking water. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and many East German cities, power plants using high-sulphur brown coal belch out huge clouds of smoke that stings the eyes and coats buildings with black soot. Heavy exhaust fumes from cars, trucks and buses further foul the air. Western studies indicate that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> pumps more pollution into the atmosphere than any other country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including nearly 5 million tons a year of sulphur dioxide, according to West German surveys. After the oil price rises in the 1970s, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> increasingly turned to its considerable brown coal reserves. Statistics on the extent of pollution are not made public in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but the government is under pressure to release them. An East German ecological group called the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arche </ORGANIZATION> has demanded that the government `` stop treating evidence of environmental pollution as state secrets.'' Underground ecology newspapers detailing local pollution problems are frequently seized. While East German officials have shown an increased willingless to work with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on environmental problems, Western experts say they are still a long way from concrete and effective measures. `` Working groups from both sides are still working to come up with an acceptable program to help reduce the problems,'' said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Muehe </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. East German officials said at a recent environmental conference in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that a number of new projects had been launched to reduce river pollution and that the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would likely be cleaned up by 1992. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichelt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Minister for <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted in the state-run media as saying that all new and refitted power plants would be equipped with filtration devices beginning next year. But West German officials say that in order to make any substantial progress soon, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will have to provide the East Germans with technology and financial assistance. While <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was the first Eastern European nation to enact strict environmental laws, the guidelines are rarely enforced, Western officials say. West German government studies indicate that cleanup tasks will be difficult because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has largely abandoned environmental protection programs in recent years. `` The last two five-year plans have contained neither a detailed environmental program nor funds to carry out projects outlined in earlier plans,'' a West German government study said. `` Because of increasing economic pressures, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has made industrial growth and increased production a priority over environmental protection.'' West German officials, who are grappling with the heavily industrialized nation's own formidable environmental problems, say the East German pollution is of grave concern. `` Our own efforts to correct environmental problems are made significantly more difficult because of the East German pollutants,'' <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Huthmacher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, referring to efforts to clean up the nation's rivers and to reduce emissions that cause acid rain. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s forests have suffered considerable damage because of acid rain. Environmental experts also say East German factories dump tons of untreated industrial wastes into waterways where it mixes with the runoff from fields treated with nitrate fertilizers. Many major rivers flow into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, more than 100 tons of waste _ including heavy metals, industrial sludge, raw sewage and pesticides _ flow into the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> each day in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE COMMITMENT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For 11 days, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Casciano </PERSON> has fought the battle of <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, riding herd on wave after wave of oil with his nimble 27-foot fishing boat. For 11 nights, he has slept in the boat's tiny cabin so he'd be ready at first light to continue the deadening routine of coralling oil away from the salmon hatchery up the bay. `` It's fairly boring, but hopefully we're doing some good here,'' he said. <PERSON> Casciano </PERSON> and his fellow fishermen have done some good. But their rescue of the hatchery is a brief skirmish in a losing fight to limit the damage of 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. `` It's really frustrating when you consider what little you're accomplishing with all the effort here,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, who had his 48-foot Sound Adventure working with Casciano's Commitment on Monday `` When you think about what little oil you've picked up, it blows your mind.'' The view from above Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> speaks to the seeming futility of the cleanup effort. The lower end of the sound is a checkerboard of oil. Rainbow swirls of oil nudge the shore in the hundreds of lonely bays and inlets. Mud-colored oil streamers stripe the deep green water of the open sound. The powerful forces of nature have taken man's mistake and scattered it hundreds of miles. No one knows this better than fishermen like <PERSON> Casciano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, neighbors from <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> who have looked to the sound for their living. While officials dusted off contingency plans and held assessment meetings, the fishermen of the sound streamed out of towns like <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seward </PERSON> to do what they could. Most went without knowing they would be compensated for their efforts. Casciano and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> were at <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> for five days before they received contracts from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the only contact they have had with the company responsible for the spill. `` All of us figured that if nothing else, at least we're out here doing something,'' said <PERSON> Casciano </PERSON>. The independent fishermen organized their own battle plan. Booms were floated across the inner bay. The fishing boats took what materials they could get and began collecting the oil, using the same techniques they have used for years for fishing. A yellow, oil-smeared boom was attached at one end to Commitment, the other to Sound Adventure. Using hand signals and radio calls, the two boats moved in graceful ballet until clumps of oil, resembling greasy brown oatmeal, were snared in the boom. The strategy is similar to the way two boats can use seining nets to trap schools of salmon and herring. The oil was then floated to a `` sucker boat,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skimmer that sluices the oil from the water and into a small barge. But often, over the past two weeks, there has been no skimmer to feed. The special boats can only swallow 32 barrels of oil before their tanks are filled and they have to go unload. Whatever the fishermen are paid for the effort will fall short of the cost of what the spill may do their way of life. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> lost at least $ 40,000 when the spill canceled the herring harvest. In normal times, his wife and daughter would be on the boat with him for weeks, helping catch fish. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> was aboard Sound Adventure on Monday after flying out to be with her husband. `` Everybody back at town is worried that our way of life may be over,'' she said. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Raymonds </ORGANIZATION> and Casciano are pessimistic about what their efforts mean against the massive amount of oil and unrelenting forces of nature. But they say it is better to be on the water, doing something, then sitting ashore. `` Maybe what you do is not going to make a dent, but you've got to try to do something to help,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>CHANDIPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As dusk descends on this seaside village, men light kerosene lamps and women keep conch shells handy for a night vigil against the enemy _ a ballistic missile. It is not from an enemy country. Chandipur's 12,000 villagers want to stall the test-firing of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first long-range ballistic missile. They say it is potentially dangerous and eventually will make them homeless. They fear the missile named `` AGNI,'' which means `` fire'' in <LOCATION> Hindi </LOCATION>, may carry nuclear warheads. The test-firing scheduled later this month will bracket <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in ballistic missile capability, military experts say. It also will enhance the power of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 1.36 million-strong army and the country's geopolitical influence in the region, they say. `` It is more a technology demonstration, but it can be used in defense should the country require,'' said V.S. <PERSON> Arunachalam </PERSON>, who has overseen <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s defense research since 1982. `` Will it carry nuclear warheads?'' he asked. `` If you want, you can carry a nuclear warhead even on a bullock cart.'' Since April 1987, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> successfully has tested three types of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, with ranges varying from 5 -LCB- to 155 miles. Villagers in <LOCATION> Chandipur </LOCATION> are being lured with money and promises of free food and popular film videos if they leave their homes during launch time and move to temporary camps set up in the area. But they refuse to budge, and the battle of wits shows no sign of settlement. At the maximum-security launch site on the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> about 300 scientists and technocrats are putting final touches to the missile. They expect it to travel between 370 miles and 1,550 miles, a scientist said on condition of anonymity. The missile will carry a one-ton payload. `` The project is one of great national importance,'' Lt. Gen. R.S. <PERSON> Deswal </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Test </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` This is what we are telling the villagers.'' Military test-firing is nothing new to this village, where the colonial British set up an arms and ammunition test range 95 years ago. Scientists have been experimenting with two other missiles that were test-fired in 1987 and in 1988. But what sparked the controversy surrounding the new missile was an official announcement earlier this year asking villagers to vacate their homes. `` For the past three years, we are asking the government what is happening,'' said <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>, a former legislator who heads the main anti-missile group. `` Their stock reply was ` nothing major, just routine firing and enlarging the facilities.' Now out of the blue they are telling us that they will fire a real big missile.'' Most Chandipur residents are fishermen or farmers who arrived here after the 1942 <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> famine, which killed up to 1 million people. `` Let them fire the missile, but we not going to leave our homes,'' said <PERSON> Gaur </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chandipur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` They will have to fire a missile first at us and then they can fire another at the sky. `` We have said we will not go,'' he said. `` We maintain a nightlong vigil because we fear that they may force us out.'' Conch shells are blown to alert people in other hamlets. The government wants the people living in a two-mile radius of the launch pad to vacate their homes for four hours during the launch. But villagers fear it is a ploy. `` We are not asking them to leave for good, just during the launch period,'' said the general, who said officials have offered every adult $ 5.20 and each child $ 2.60 as compensation. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said: `` It is good money, no doubt, but should you trade your existence for that?''

 A housewife is appealing a $ 25 fine for airing her bedding after 10 a.m., saying the 30-year-old law that prohibits the practice is outdated.

 Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> championship basketball game gave <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> a rare first place for the week in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> television ratings. This year's game, in which <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> defeated Seton Hall by one point in overtime, was in the top 10. But it was n't enough to knock <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> out of first place, where it has been for 42 straight weeks. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week that ended Sunday with a 15.4 rating. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 13.0 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.5. For the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has a 16.0 rating, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.9 and CBS 12.6. The week was fairly typical, except that the onset of daylight saving time seemed to affect the earlier shows since viewers tend to be less eager to plop in front of the tube when it's still light outside. Therefore, `` The Cosby Show,'' which starts off the night for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, found itself in second place behind <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' which is broadcast an hour later on Tuesday night, even though `` Cosby'' had a bigger share of the audience `` Roseanne'' had the highest rating _ 23.3, but a 35 share. `` Cosby'' had a 22.4 rating, but a 38 share. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 9.4 million homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets actually in use. Daylight saving time also affected the news ratings, all were down somewhat. `` ABC World News Tonight'' was first with a 10.1 rating and a 20 share, slightly ahead of the `` CBS Evening News'' with a 9.9 and 20 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.9 and 18 share. The top 10 prime-time shows last week were: `` Roseanne'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> Championship _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Empty Nest'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` L.A. Law'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and `` Murder, She Wrote'' CBS. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Columbo'' came in 12th for the week, a good showing. The bad news for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is `` Moonlighting,'' which was in the bottom 10. `` Moonlighting'' went on hiatus earlier this year, then moved to Sunday night where it had a 6.2 and 10 share last week. Only two other prime-time shows, both on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, rank lower: `` HeartBeat'' and `` Men.'' Even <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> had three shows with higher ratings than `` Moonlighting.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> got a so-so performance out of the premiere of `` The Robert Guillaume Show'' which finished 46th. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> won the Sunday movie battle with a repeat of `` Romancing the Stone.'' It was 15th, out-rating <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> movie, at 18th. CBS' `` Bridge to Silence,'' starring <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> in her first speaking role, ranked 35th. CBS' Sunday schedule was pushed back because of an overrun of the Masters golf tournament. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Hard Time on Planet Earth,'' `` Mission Impossible,'' `` Rock' n' Roll Mom,'' `` Quantum Leap,'' `` Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting,'' `` Great Circuses of the World,'' `` A Man Called Hawk,'' `` Moonlighting, `` HeartBeat'' and `` Men.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was the early leader in his campaign for a historic fifth term as mayor of the nation's second-largest city, capturing 54 percent of the absentee vote in a race characterized by low voter turnout <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 71, the city's first black mayor, needed at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a June 6 runoff. Forty-five minutes after the polls closed at 8 p.m., <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was in the lead with 13,146 absentee ballots, or 54 percent, according to the City Clerk's Office. The next-closest contender was freshman City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who received 5,014 absentee votes, or 20.66 percent. Former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor and television commentator <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had 4,800 votes, or 19.7 percent. Although virtually no observers believed the mayor could lose, one newspaper reported that a secret poll conducted by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s campaign last week showed the mayor with just 53 percent of the vote <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> pollster <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maullin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> that the polls conducted April 2 and 3 contained questions checking the impact of a city attorney's office ethics investigation of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. But, <PERSON> Maullin </PERSON> said, `` None of the results showed <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> not winning outright.'' City Clerk <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had predicted a 25 percent to 30 percent turnout _ `` a historical low for a mayoral election.'' Voters faced morning low clouds and drizzle, and the turnout by 4 p.m. was only 11.6 percent of the city's 1.9 million registered voters. A poll taken recently by The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> showed 78 percent of Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable impression of the Democratic mayor. That led <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> to be dubbed the `` Teflon mayor,'' because he is apparently not blamed for the city's mounting urban problems. The only currently elected official challenging <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, freshman City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, was considered his only serious opponent in the non-partisan race, but hardly a threat to the 16-year mayor. Other candidates included a former county supervisor, a socialist oil field worker and a singer-dancer who used to cavort in a green bikini across the street from City Hall every day. The winner of Tuesday's mayor's race will oversee <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at least into the early 1990s, leading a city with a population that is swelling past 3 million people.

 Pollsters and would-be opponents such as City Councilman <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON> agree that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s low-key image has kept him from being linked in voters' minds with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' growing problems, including criminal gangs, illegal drug trade, traffic congestion and a failing sewage system. <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON> had widely been considered <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s leading challenger, but backed out of the race after apparently deciding that he could n't win. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s image even appeared untarnished by an ethics investigation by the city attorney's office, which learned that the mayor had performed consulting work with <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which did business with the city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> returned the $ 18,000 in fees he was paid by the bank and called the charges politically motivated. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sharecropper and the grandson of slaves, was first elected mayor of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1973. A track star at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he first entered public service as a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police lieutenant, and later was elected to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> City Council. He was defeated in his first run at mayor in a bitter 1969 race against incumbent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yorty </PERSON> that critics said was tinged with racism, but came back to beat <PERSON> Yorty </PERSON> the next time around. At the end of his current term, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> will become the first mayor in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> history to have served four full terms.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Resorting to Gimmicks, Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Budget negotiators from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are turning to accounting gimmicks and asset sales for a major portion of their budget package, after failing to reach agreement on strong deficit-reduction steps. The group is struggling to wrap up more than a month of talks aimed at shaving about $ 28 billion from the fiscal 1990 deficit. That would reduce red ink to about $ 100 billion next year as mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law, according to White House estimates. Budget experts agree that any long-term solution to the huge deficit problem requires a meaningful shift in fiscal policy. Translation: either significant new taxes or reductions in federal programs or a combination of the two. But with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposing new taxes or cuts in military spending or foreign aid, and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sure to reject deep cuts in domestic programs, the negotiators are able to only nibble at the edges of major policy changes this year. That scenario has been reinforced directly in recent days as members of the negotiating team have presented ideas to their constituencies in the White House or on congressional committees. In many cases, they've been told to look elsewhere to reduce the deficit or face rejection, said sources familiar with the closed-door meetings. So in an effort to avert a crisis, such as violating Gramm-Rudman and triggering its automatic spending cuts, the talks have turned increasingly toward the smoke and mirrors approach to budgeting. They are considering: _ Moving payment of some farm subsidies ahead so the checks are written this fiscal year instead of next, a shift that makes fiscal 1990 look nearly $ 1 billion trimmer _ Taking the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Postal Service `` off-budget,'' knocking nearly $ 2 billion in red ink off the books next year. _ Making an accounting change in the food stamp program to `` save'' another $ 500 million _ Selling off nearly $ 6 billion in government assets _ a policy which often brings in money at first but then costs money in the long run Other items on the list that take advantage of federal accounting methods include claiming credit for $ 2 billion trimmed from the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program by simply extending existing cost controls, and about $ 600 million by continuing a retirement policy for federal employees. The group is even prepared to claim $ 100 million in savings because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year rejected a pay raise for itself and other top federal officials, according to one source. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, declined to discuss any specifics, but conceded the negotiators were struggling. `` We've got to reach this goal in a credible way, and it's not easy,'' he said. `` Under the circumstances we are working with, we are reaching the best possible solution.'' But, he added, `` There's no question that this -LRB- package -RRB- is going to send a message that more needs to be done.'' The budget negotiations have dragged on longer than planned, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will not meet its April 15 deadline for passing a budget resolution. The budget serves as a blueprint for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' annual spending bills and tax legislation. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, if the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fail to enact legislation that will reduce the deficit to within $ 10 billion of next year's $ 100 billion target, the administration must make across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.

<HEAD>Big Foreign Purchases of Feed Corn Offset Domestic Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign buyers are gobbling up huge amounts of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn supply, but domestic livestock feeders are easing back on use of the mighty feed grain. A new supply-and-demand analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed Tuesday that corn exports may total 2.1 billion bushels in the marketing year that began last Sept. 1. The new forecast was up by 100 million bushels from indications a month ago and 21 percent more than the 1.73 billion shipped in 1987-88. Exports at that level would be the highest since corn shipments totaled 2.4 billion bushels in 1980-81. About 4 billion bushels of corn are expected to be used as livestock feed this year, down from 4.3 billion forecast in March and well below the record of 4.74 billion bushels consumed a year earlier. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records, that would put feed use at the lowest since 3.82 billion bushels were fed to livestock in 1983-84. Corn is the largest and most important field crop grown by American farmers. As livestock feed it helps produce the bulk of the meat, poultry and dairy products that reach consumers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile at the beginning of the new corn marketing year this coming Sept. 1 is forecast at 1.83 billion bushels, up from the 1.66 billion bushels indicated in March. Last Sept. 1, before the drought-shriveled 1988 corn harvest was added to the supply, the corn carryover was 4.23 billion bushels. With a reduced supply, corn prices shot up from an average of $ 1.94 per bushel in 1987-88 to a projected range of $ 2.45 to $ 2.70 this season. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat carryover on June 1, the beginning of the new wheat marketing year, was indicated at 549 million bushels, up slightly from 534 million forecast last month but far below the 1.26 billion bushels in the inventory last June 1. Wheat exports and domestic use are down, but the main impact has been the reduced 1988 harvest. Wheat prices are expected to average $ 3.65 to $ 3.80 per bushel this season, up from $ 2.57 in 1987-88. The soybean situation reflects a bare-bones level of supply, with the carryover on Sept. 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year, expected to be about 145 million bushels, compared with 302 million last Sept. 1. Drought reduced last year's production, forcing prices higher. The report forecast soybeans might average $ 7.20 to $ 7.60 per bushel this season, compared with $ 5.88 in 1987-88. Exports and domestic use are both down. The report also said that total meat production this year is now expected to be about 0.2 percent less than forecast last month because of a decline in poultry prospects. Even so, 1989 combine production of poultry and red meat is expected to reach a record level.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says a vaccine has been invented to make pigs piggier. Pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of 22.5 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs without the treatment, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported on Tuesday. `` If a commercial product results from this venture and is approved by regulator agencies, it could mean more quality pork produced at lower cost and in less time,'' said animal physiologist <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekas </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency has signed a three-year cooperative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Codon </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> biotechnology firm, for development and further testing of the vaccine. <PERSON> Pekas </PERSON>, who works at the agency's meat animal research center in Clay Center, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment of cholecystokinin, a natural appetite-limiting hormone made in the upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans. When the fragment, called CCK-8, is joined to a larger foreign carrier protein, the animal's immune system recognizes the fragment as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the natural CCK hormone, he said. When that happens, there is nothing to tell pigs when they've had enough to eat So they keep on eating.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the orange harvest for the 1988-89 crop season is estimated at about 207.8 million boxes, down 1 percent from the March forecast but 4 percent above last year's production. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> production, based on April 1 indications, was estimated at 144.3 million boxes, down 1 percent from last month but 5 percent more than last season, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> harvest was estimated at 60 million boxes, down almost 2 percent from the March forecast but 2 percent more than produced in 1987-88. The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> crop was indicated at 1.55 million boxes, down 22 percent from the previous forecast for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in January _ which had been carried forward into February and March _ and 14 percent less than last season. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> production, at 1.9 million boxes, was unchanged from the March forecast but was 33 percent above last season's harvest.

 The new Earl of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> _ a retired Australian sheep shearer _ received a guided tour of his family seat in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and called it a nice place. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiennes-Clinton </PERSON>, 75, visiting <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for the first time Tuesday and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the second time, said he hopes to take advantage of the only real perk offered by his title _ a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, the unelected upper chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

 A new sightseeing business has arrived on the scene in the nation's capital: guided tours conducted by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been taking his guests to see the sights, something predecessor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rarely did. For <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, it was a trip by helicopter to nearby <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for a baseball game. There, the two presidents sat in a box and ate hot dogs and hamburgers and debated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s high-and-outside season-opening pitch. For <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, it was a trip past the <LOCATION> Tidal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> for a glimpse of the city's famed cherry blossoms and then to the Air and Space Museum, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s most-visited attractions The two joined springtime tourists in the museum's wide-screened theater to watch the movie `` To Fly.'' Excited conversation rippled through the audience as people realized who was in their midst, and those who had cameras used them for snapshots. Next week, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will be in town. And it's anyone's guess where the president might take him `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a city of 1,000 monuments,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We may end up visiting them all.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to take <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, next month. And he threw open the doors of the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set the theme early in his presidency, when he opened the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the public the Saturday after his inauguration. And, at one reception for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a Polaroid camera to take instant photos of lawmakers in the Lincoln Bedroom. On the way to the Air and Space museum, the Bush-Shamir motorcade passed a line of life-sized standup photographs that have proliferated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the past few years. For instance, for a $ 5 fee you can have your picture taken with a cutout of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the first lady or both. In the final photograph, it looks like you were standing next to the first family in front of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> landmark. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, there have been such cutouts for several years: first the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, and now the Bushes. For a while, a cutout of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> also appeared, but popular demand trailed off and it has been removed. But outside the Air and Space museum, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now share sidewalk space with other celebrities, including cutouts of wrestling star <PERSON> Hulk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, and a new addition: Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It would have been hard for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to miss the life-sized likeness of the Soviet leader. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was right on the corner, just feet from the official motorcade. But if the president had any reaction, it went unreported. The president is often out and about town, frequently taking guests with him in his limousine. And, since he has a habit of stopping at red lights when he's on a social or recreational call, his motorcade often produces expressions of surprise and delight from other motorists and passersby as they realize the man in the stopped car alongside them is none other than the president. Those on the street might have done a double take one day last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wearing exercise clothes, took his motorcade to the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building, where he played racquetball in the House gym. Running late for a formal dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerged from the gym two hours later wearing a tuxedo.

<TEXT>
 Terrorism rose to record heights in 1988, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suffered a substantial increase and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> remained the favorite target, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in December over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which the department's office of counter terrorism said probably was a terrorist incident, and the Palestinian uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> helped push the total of incidents to a new high of 856, up 3 percent from 1987. In all, 658 people were killed and 1,131 wounded, an increase in fatalities from 633 in 1987 but a decrease in injuries from 2,272. The casualty figures include terrorists themselves who were killed or wounded during attacks as well as attacks by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally which funneled <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons to Afghan guerrillas. In all, the citizens and property of 79 nations were attacked in 60 countries. Businessmen and tourists accounted for 77 percent of the victims. The weapon used most often by terrorists was the bomb. It was used in 48 percent of the attacks, said the report released Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s top uniformed lawyer contends that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military can legally attack terrorists without violating a 1976 presidential order that bans assassinations of individuals abroad, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON>, the service's judge advocate general, argued in an eight-page draft memorandum that because of changes in `` the nature of the threat,'' action against terrorists can be justified on grounds of national self-defense. <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON>'s memorandum was disclosed Monday by the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> and confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained a primary target for international terrorism last year, as the number of anti-U.S. incidents rose from 149 in 1987 to 185. They resulted in 192 persons killed and 40 wounded, compared with seven Americans killed and 47 wounded in 1987. The increase in deaths was due largely to the attack on U.S.-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 in which 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground perished. Of the victims 189 were Americans. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was the area showing the largest percentage of incidents against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and property _ 60 percent. On the whole, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> again had the highest incidence of international terrorism, with 313 attacks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, again was the main target, accounting for 29 percent of the attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> credited <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with a substantial reduction in direct involvement in terrorism last year, but said both countries continued to provide safe haven and training to terrorist organizations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to end its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and expand ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> lessened Iranian involvement in terrorism, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued to include terrorism among its foreign-policy tools, the report said. At year's end, 20 foreigners were listed as political hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, two others possibly were dead, while 13 were released during the year. Ranked behind <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in order, as sites for the most terrorist incidents were <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The 10 countries accounted for 75 percent of the incidents during the year, the report said. The Palestinian uprising, which began in December 1987 and continued through last year in the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, should be viewed overall as a `` civil insurrection,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But the report said since it contained `` elements of terrorism'' in some instances, all civilian casualties were included in the 1988 statistics.

<HEAD>Housing Officials Say Money Needed More than Policy Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Public housing officials say <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s anti-drug proposals may help in some housing projects but what they really need is more federal money to beef up security and help tenants find jobs. `` He's not suggesting anything that has not been thought of in the past _ they just have n't had the resources,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and Redevelopment Officials. `` We've got a lot of hand-wringing going on but no help,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanaugh </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Large </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authorities </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have n't seen any money yet.'' The secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> proposed this week a series of steps for fighting drugs in federally supported housing projects in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said they `` are applicable to every public housing authority in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' and will be issued in `` action memos'' to all locally run public housing authorities. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s package includes only one direct <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> action: dropping government hearing procedures that may delay eviction of tenants who use or sell drugs, so long as the tenants receive due process in the courts. His other proposals were suggestions, including more police patrols, installing security fences around projects, establishing guarded entrances, renovating the projects and requiring photo identification cards for residents. He provided no cost estimate but said he would go to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ask for more money if needed. District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials on Tuesday formally asked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to drop its requirement for hearings before evicting tenants for drug use or firearm violations. But some housing officials said the move might not be possible in some states, and that it might not speed up the eviction process very much in others. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, housing authority spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toohey </PERSON> said, the hearing process works well and keeps most cases from ever going to court. `` We are not about to change our ... grievance procedures,'' he said. <PERSON> Cavanaugh </PERSON> said many of the nation's 3,000 public housing authorities might want to drop the hearing procedures, but that the more serious delays in evictions are in the court system and would not be changed. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said laws in some states do not appear to provide enough protection for tenants in eviction cases to meet <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines for waiving the formal hearing procedures. The proposal to fence in housing projects will be controversial and likely will be rejected in most cases, according to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whose organization represents 90 percent of the local public housing agencies that operate federally subsidized housing. He said a main concern of public housing agencies is making projects blend in with the surrounding neighborhoods, and fencing would only make them stand out and be even more attractive to drug activity by outsiders. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> acknowledged on Monday that fences may not work in all cases and said they should be considered on a case-by-case basis. `` A security fence may be different from barbed wire,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We're not trying to keep people in. We're trying to get drug users from getting in.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, housing authorities have no plans to require residents to have photo identification cards or to surround projects with fences, said <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, spokesman for the city housing authority. He called the steps `` draconian.'' `` We're not that demoralized,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s need is for more money _ to increase its public housing authority police force and to provide job training for tenants. But some other cities, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, have already begun issuing photo identification cards in certain cases, such as for tenants of high-rise and senior-citizen projects. Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s enthusiasm and said most of his suggestions could be useful. But he cautioned that increasing security in projects may only move drug problems into surrounding areas unless broader programs are provided to poor urban residents.

<HEAD>Interior Renewing California Water Leases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, although conceding possible environmental problems, is renewing long-term water leases to farmers in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in an attempt to put to rest an emotional fight over federal water in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The controversy over water distribution to central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farmers has been marked by disagreement within the administration for months. Environmentalists have characterized the outcome as another barometer on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's desire to protect the environment and natural resources. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which issues the leases, has favored automatic renewal, while the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has argued that a formal environmental assessment should first be made. The president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> is planning to review the matter Thursday. But Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, announced Tuesday that he has decided to renew the first lease to come before the department, committing federal water to the Orange Cove Irrigation District in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for another 40 years. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the decision would not affect the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> council's proceedings. The council has no authority to block the leases or order a formal environmental impact statement, although its views historically have been given considerable weight by agencies and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This decision further corrodes the environmental credentials of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources While the lease renewal announced Tuesday involves only one of a number of central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> irrigation projects, it was viewed widely as an indication of how the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> likely will deal with future renewal cases as other long-term leases expire. Environmentalists have opposed renewal of the long-term leases because the commitment locks the government into supplying a certain volume of water to farmers well into the next century at a time when rapid population growth is creating new, non-farm water demands. As water continues to be diverted for both agriculture and urban use, streams will dry up and seasonal wetlands, which support migratory waterfowl, will disappear, the critics maintain. The leases provide for water delivered through the Friant Unit of the Central Valley Project, a massive central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> irrigation system, that each year provides 1.5 billion acre feet of federal water to central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farms and orchards through an elaborate system of dams and canals. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> in a statement conceded that the long-term leases `` may pose legitimate environmental concerns.'' But he said those concerns could be resolved by state and local officials. He directed the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an environmental assessment and provide it to those officials for consideration so the state and local officials may then `` adopt environmentally sensitive operating procedures and water policies.'' But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>, director of the office of federal activities at the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, suggested <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s procedures for dealing with environmental concerns amount to `` sidestepping'' the National Environmental Policy Act under which environmentalists had sought to get a formal environmental impact statement, or <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION>, before any leases were renewed. The environmental review directed by <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> `` is essentially different than doing an <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> in an interview. `` Our position -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is the entire water issue for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> needs to be reviewed in light of today's environmental standards and particularly the environmental requirements 40 years hence,'' <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, an attorney who represents several environmental groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in challenging the lease renewals in a lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, accused <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> of `` undermining the procedures'' established to deal with the environmental concerns. `` It's kind of backward to sign the leases and then order and environmental assessment,'' <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> suggested that the issuance of the one lease renewal would not affect the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> environmental council's review of the broader environmental issues involving all of the upcoming leases. He also said the Orange Cove lease would encourage increased water conservation among the farmers by charging `` substantially higher prices'' for the water. Under the new contract with <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, the cost of federal water would quadruple from $ 3.50 to $ 14.94 per acre foot, he said. An acre foot is an amount of water need to flood an acre of land one foot deep, or about 350,000 gallons.

<HEAD>New Regulations Possible for Aging Airliners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is moving to impose new maintenance standards on older airliners, but industry officials say the agency needs to do a more thorough job of inspecting the aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee examined the problem of aging airliners at a hearing on Tuesday, a session that also produced a warning from the panel's chairman that tougher government regulations might be on the way. The chairman, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., told reporters after the session that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should consider requiring the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to force an increase in the frequency of inspections of older aircraft, require replacing certain parts rather than examinations of them, and set training and experience standards for airline inspectors and mechanics Ever since the roof of a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 peeled off over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last April, sweeping a flight attendant to her death, attention has been focused on the older aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's major airlines agreed in February to more than $ 800 million worth of improvements to be made on 1,300 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners. The goal is to eliminate certain routine inspections in favor of design improvements and a schedule for regular replacements of certain parts. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for regulation, said that late this month or in early May, the agency will propose rules that would require more than 160 structural changes in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s, 737s and 747s. The last year has been a difficult one for the older members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline fleet. Nine people died in December when a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 broke open over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>; a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 landed without casualties after a hole opened in its fuselage while flying over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; and an 8-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727 lost an engine during takeoff from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The average age of airliners used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers is 12.7 years, up from 8 years in 1980. It is expected to be 15 years by the year 2000, because there are backlogs of orders for new aircraft and an ever-growing passenger load. At the hearing, officials from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the airlines and the aircraft manufacturing industry assured lawmakers that improvements were being made constantly in how aircraft are constructed, maintained, tested and inspected. But <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, a vice president for engineering for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors should spend more time examining airlines and less time checking paperwork, and complained that <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> fines for maintenance infractions can be counterproductive. `` Routine use of such penalties tends to drive problems underground and communication in the industry suffers,'' <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON>, engineering vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the major airlines, said the group is considering whether inspectors and mechanics for all carriers should be required to meet uniform training standards. This angered <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who asked: `` Why should there be any question but that you should go ahead with strict training and education across-the-board?''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's vote to impose a new fairness doctrine on broadcasters sets the stage for a confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a probable <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> challenge. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> issued the challenge Tuesday when on a voice vote it approved a fairness doctrine bill introduced by committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. The bill goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where it is expected to pass easily. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has told <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> that it will urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto any fairness doctrine law that passes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed an identical bill in 1987, the same year the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> repealed its doctrine on the grounds it violated the First Amendment and no longer served the public interest in an era of diverse media outlets. The 50-year-old rules required broadcasters to air opposing views of controversial issues. If the bill should pass both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and become law, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> test also would seem likely because of what opponents say is the doctrine's unconstitutional infringement on broadcasters' rights. A federal appeals court earlier this year ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had the authority to scrap the doctrine, but the court sidestepped the issue of the doctrine's constitutionality. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the fairness doctrine is not a great burden on broadcasters and only assures `` more speech'' on public issues The bill would not impose criminal sanctions on broadcasters who violate the doctrine, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said, adding that a station never has lost its license for fairness doctrine infractions. The committee's ranking Republican, Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the bill is designed to provide `` a minimal assurance of fair play.'' Opponents included Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who said, `` This is a clear violation of the First Amendment.'' He also disputed the view that broadcasters must be required to be fair because they are licensed to exploit a `` scarce'' medium _ the airwaves. `` Our founding fathers had the question before them: ` Do we want a fair press or do we want a free press?' And they made the choice that we ought to have a free press,'' <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said. `` There were at that time very few media outlets in the nation,'' he said. `` And of course then as today it was abundantly clear that some of those media outlets sometimes engaged in activities which were perceived, may actually have been, unfair. But the founding fathers said there was a greater risk in attempting to control the media by imposing fairness than there is in permitting a free media to perhaps occasionally be unfair.'' The fairness doctrine has been opposed by many broadcasters, particularly smaller station owners who say the threat of lawsuits is enough to make them just play music instead of discussing controversial issues.

 A spectacular five-alarm fire Tuesday destroyed a roofing materials warehouse, forced the evacuation of nearby buildings and injured two warehouse workers slightly, firefighters said. The blaze sent a towering column of smoke over the suburban area between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, knocked out electricity to downtown <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> and snarled traffic as stoplights went dark and motorists slowed for a glimpse of the flames. Four other buildings in an area of more than 100,000 square feet also were engulfed in flames. An undetermined number of people were evacuated from four nearby businesses, and firefighters hosed down a house across the street that was threatened by the flames. No firefighters were hurt, although shifting winds blew sparks and flaming tarpaper around the <ORGANIZATION> Leatherback </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the smoke could pose a threat to area residents with respiratory problems. Most of the smoke was blown to the south, but some stayed in the area. The fire apparently started around 2:30 p.m. near an electrical panel, but the cause remained undetermined, authorities said. Damage initially was estimated at about $ 1 million. Fire officials estimated it would take the 75 firefighters from five jurisdictions at least 12 hours to extinguish. The building contained large amounts of felt paper and tar to make tarpaper for roofing, said an <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who refused to give his name. `` It's hot and it's nasty,'' he said. Asphalt stored at 300 to 400 degrees in the warehouse had only to get a bit too hot to burst into flames, he said. Two Leatherback workers were treated for minor burns after trying to extinguish the fire earlier in the day, officials said. The blaze spread despite a sprinkler system, and the two workers and nine other employees fled, workers said. Several tanks of industrial chemicals exploded. Firefighters tried to prevent flames from reaching a 61,000-gallon tank of liquid asphalt and a large propane tank.

<HEAD>Study Says Rural and Inner-City Poverty Rates are Similar</HEAD>

 Country people were just as poor during the economic recovery as they were during the last decade's recession, according to a study that found little difference between urban and rural poverty. The study, Poverty in <LOCATION> Rural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: A National Overview, said more than one in six people in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fell below the federal poverty line of $ 9,056 for a family of three in 1987 while the rate was one in eight for residents of metropolitan areas during that year. `` In fact, the rural poverty rate for 1987 _ the fifth year of an economic recovery _ was as high as the rate for 1975, the deepest recession year of the 1970s,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and Policy Priorities, while presenting the study Tuesday to a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, Youth and Families. Using data from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> on poverty from 1978 to 1987, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that the rural poverty rate rose from 13.5 percent to 16.9 percent. In metropolitan areas during the same period, the rate rose from 10.4 percent to 12.5 percent. Metropolitan areas comprise one or more cities and their suburbs. In the central cities, which frequently are associated with poverty, the rate climbed from 15.4 percent to 18.6 percent, according to the study. `` What's most striking is that the rate of poverty in rural areas is almost as high as in central cities,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said Tuesday in an interview. The center, a nonprofit organization which conducts research and analysis on a range of public policy issues concerning low-income families and individuals, found the changes in poverty consistent among most racial, ethnic, age and demographic groups. The rural poor are more likely to be white because there is a lower proportion of minorities in nonmetropolitan areas, but `` more than two-fifths -LRB- 44.1 percent -RRB- of nonmetro blacks were poor in 1987, compared to one-third -LRB- 33.3 percent -RRB- of blacks living in central cities.'' There also were more poor elderly people living in rural than urban areas, the study said. The only segment of the rural poor that was smaller than its urban counterpart was children. According to the study, 23.1 percent of rural children were poor while 29.6 percent of the children in the central cities were poor in 1987. But one feature that distinguished the rural poor from their urban counterparts is that rural poverty is likely to occur in two-parent families where one or both parents work. `` Nearly two of every three poor families living in rural areas contained at least one worker in 1987,'' the study said. `` Nearly one quarter had at least two workers.''

 Witchcraft is not uncommon in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where open air markets sell magic amulets and powders and where one can easily hire a witch to cast a spell on a rival. But an anthropologist consulted Tuesday said satanic rituals are rare. Police believe such rituals were performed in the killings of 12 people in the northern border city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. The bodies, including that of a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student, were discovered in a mass grave Tuesday on a ranch just south of the U.S.-Mexico border. Police said a satanic cult of drug smugglers killed them in hopes that human sacrifice would protect them. `` This is the most horrible thing ever seen in the city's history,'' said <PERSON> Enriqueta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a reporter covering the story for the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bravo </ORGANIZATION> `` This is more like something you would hear about in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>.'' The southern states of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> are known for their large numbers of `` brujos'', or witches, and their occult rites. But even in those areas, the rites are not considered `` satanic'' because they have no connection with the Christian devil. The witches may sacrifice animals such as black-feathered roosters, but ritual killings of human beings are almost unheard of. American anthropologists <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Medsen </PERSON> differentiate between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s traditional Indian witches and what they call `` satanic witches'' in their 1969 book `` The American Guide to Mexican Witchcraft.'' `` The satanic witchcraft practiced in cities and towns is a far cry from Indian witchcraft, although this distinction has been ignored by anthropologists,'' they wrote. `` Indian witchcraft has little or no connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> devil, who dominates the suburban sorcery scene. `` The most feared witches in urban <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are those who make pacts with the devil. A satanic witch voluntarily sells his soul to the devil in exchange for wealth and power,'' the book says. An anthropologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthropology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said satanic cults are rare in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because they are elitist and expensive, in part because of drugs used in the ceremonies. `` From colonial times, it never was successful'' in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said the anthropologist, who asked that her name not be used. On the other hand, herbal medicine and use of witch doctors, called `` curanderos,'' is common in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Most markets have stalls where herbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or bad spells or to cleanse a home of evil. Human sacrifice was common in the country's pre-Columbian Indian cultures; the Aztecs killed thousands every year, usually captured enemy soldiers, and practiced cannibalism. Human sacrifice is little known now, although not unheard of. It is said to be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is killed as part of the process of curing another. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, a police reporter for the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> tabloid <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said one of the few cases he had heard of involved the slaying of an unidentifed man whose headless body was discovered about three months ago next to a hill in the northern part of the city. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> said officials found the body near a circle of stones enclosing a triangle. The head was found on the other side of the hill.

 Fire swept through an apartment house early Tuesday, killing seven children and two young mothers, and police later arrested a homeless man but did not link him to the blaze. The three other occupants of the building were injured, two of them seriously. Fire Chief G. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the cause remained under investigation and authorities were focusing on a gas heater near where the fire started. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said that based on an initial investigation, authorities did not suspect arson. The blaze started about 2 a.m. on the first floor and had engulfed the two-story, wood-frame structure by the time firefighters responded. `` The fire was just blazing all of a sudden. ... I ca n't remember hearing -LRB- noise -RRB- or anything,'' said <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, a relative of several of the victims who lived across the street and was first to call the fire department, at 2:20 a.m. `` I had never seen people come out burned like that,'' she continued `` I was just hysterical.'' Police and fire authorities, aided by arson investigators from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, were examining the rubble in a working-class neighborhood in this central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city of about 130,000. Smoke detectors were found upstairs and down, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, but the downstairs detector was connected directly to the building's wiring and electricity service had been cut April 4 by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> He was uncertain about the upstairs detector. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the fire originated in a room off the foyer near the entrance of the building. He said a folding bed was in the room, but it was not being used at the time of the fire. Three families, consisting of four adults and eight children, lived in the house, and had moved there last year, officials said. Police Capt. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlavy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who was treated at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and released, was the only survivor to have been interviewed. `` He woke up, went down the stairs and it was hot and he had to go, of course, back upstairs and try to wake the others,'' she said. `` And then he went out the window onto the roof and was rescued by the fire department with a ladder.'' Later Tuesday, police arrested <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, 34, and charged him with criminal trespass for living in the first floor of the building without permission, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. An apartment on the first floor was vacant. `` He's somewhat of a homeless person,'' the fire chief said. `` He stayed there sometimes.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> was at the building Monday night, and left at 11:30 p.m., said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> was being held at the <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said rescuers found `` people standing on the porch and some people on the roof. There were people already injured when we got there. `` As soon as we knocked the fire down, it would come back up again. This happened two or three times,'' he said. Several neighbors said they watched helplessly as the fire swept the house. `` The kid was up there waving her hands like she was yelling for help and the flames were all around her,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 34, who was visiting his sister in the apartment building next door. Three people died at the scene and six were pronounced dead at two hospitals, said <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzbee </PERSON>. The children ranged in age from 2 months to 10 years, he said. `` As far as we know this is the worst fire we've ever had in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> in terms of deaths,'' the coroner said. Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> said he believed the cause of death was smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 14, were in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> Franciscan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Neva </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldene </PERSON>.

 A British Airways Concorde jet on a world-circling journey lost a piece of its tail in flight but landed safely at <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> international airport on Wednesday. There were no reports of injuries. The Concorde, making the first all-supersonic flight around the world, was trying to set more than one dozen speed records as it circles the globe and had been scheduled to land in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, organizers said. `` About 25 minutes after takeoff from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> there was a large thump,'' passenger <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilva </PERSON>, a freelance journalist, said in a telephone interview. `` Everybody looked at everybody else and lunch was served. The stewardesses looked terrified,'' she said. `` The pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about and that there was a piece loose on the airplane.'' Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, quoting Australian <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Death </PERSON>, said it appeared that part of the stabilizer at the back of the plane was missing when it landed at 12:42 p.m. -LRB- 10:42 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB- on the flight from <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The airport control tower was warned by the pilot there was a problem with the plane and all emergency vehicles were placed on standby, the radio network said. The three-week trip, covering 38,343 miles, involves 35 hours of flight. It started April 1 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and was to end there April 23. The 100-seat plane was filled to capacity with American passengers who each paid $ 39,000 for the flight.

 <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON>'s first try at videotaping turned out to be once-in-a-lifetime event. Peering through the viewfinder of a borrowed camera, she recorded the dramatic crash of a helicopter that was removing equipment from the top of her 25-story condominium building. `` It was a peculiar thing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON> said. `` I do recall that as long as you're behind the camera, you think maybe it's not real ... maybe it -LRB- the helicopter -RRB- will straighten out.'' But the craft that had begun to tilt and spin out of control first sent its load crashing to the ground and then plunged down itself. It crashed next to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station at the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> shore, but pilot <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the only person in the helicopter, escaped serious injury. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Elmhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was treated for cuts to the legs and face at <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. `` We've been very lucky here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON> said. `` At the moment it looked like it was going to be very tragic.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON>'s videotape and another taken from the roof by the building's maintenance man, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakke </PERSON>, appeared on local and network newscasts Tuesday evening. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> district manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the crash to the failure of a coupling between a transmission drive shaft and the tail rotor. As a result, he said, the rotor stopped and the helicopter started spinning clockwise, out of control, finally diving to the bank of ground next to an old submarine slip. The helicopter was a Sikorsky S-58T owned by <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON>, is a helicopter pilot with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, but Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON> said: `` I really know nothing about flying and I really know nothing about cameras. She had never used a video camera before but borrowed one from another son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, Monday night to videotape the helicopter at work. She and her husband, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, watched from a small park as the helicopter arrived and began removing air conditioning equipment from the roof. As the helicopter carried the largest piece, believed to weigh about 2 tons, the rotor snapped, Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON> said. On the videotape's soundtrack, `` you hear kind of a grinding noise a little bit before he lets go of the piece,'' she said. Fellow workers said the pilot signaled with his arm to those on the ground before letting go of the load. `` Everyone was stunned,'' she said. `` People were crying and very upset.'' She said the scene was too much for her granddaughter, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON>, who witnessed the accident on her second birthday. The accident left the girl very upset, said Mrs. <PERSON> Kocol </PERSON>, and she took the child inside. That's when she determined her camera work had captured the accident almost in its entirety.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been pleading <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s case before dozens of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues _ and even some lobbyists _ in sessions that critics say are flagrant violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> secrecy rules. The attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, has been representing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> throughout the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee's 10-month investigation of the speaker's financial dealings. He was permitted to attend three weeks of closed-door meetings beginning in late February at which the panel's outside counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, detailed the findings of his $ 1 million investigation. Following those sessions, <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> prepared a thick briefing book which he has used as the basis for meetings with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and a selected handful of Democratic lobbyists and political activists to present the speaker's defense arguments. The document is sprinkled throughout with allusions to <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s arguments and in some places includes direct quotes taken from secret depositions given before the committee For example, it disputes <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> marketed his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' but notes the speaker had made it clear to staff members `` that I would like for all the books to be sold that could be sold.'' `` My reaction is sort of beyond rage, into amazement,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., the speaker's chief accuser and newly elected No 2 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership official in the House. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said he was told at the time that the panel was taking the unusual step of allowing <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> to sit in on its private deliberations because it was useful for members to hear `` the initial line of reasoning'' from the speaker's attorney. But he said the process is clearly confidential under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, and for <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> later to brief Democrats, including outside lobbyists, on the case is `` an act so stupid, so fundamentally undermining the ethics process that ... I find it hard to believe he is doing that,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members of the ethics committee were `` stunned'' to hear of <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>'s activities and promised to look into the matter. The issue also came up at a Republican leadership meeting Tuesday which was attended by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political operative <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, who has vowed to make <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his ethics problems his top political target in the 1990 elections. A spokesman for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Tuesday that `` fewer than 100'' lawmakers had attended the Oldaker briefings and maintained they were proper because they stick to facts and do not involve privileged information. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has spent an entire year trying to impugn the integrity of the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' the spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said in a statement. `` He distorts the facts of this case on a daily basis. ... He is the one violating due process.'' The inch-thick briefing book prepared by <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> contains numerous allusions to <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s arguments in the closed-door meetings: _ That <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> actively marketed his book and conceded in secret testimony, `` I am sure that all the members of the staff would have concluded rightfully that I would like for all the books to be sold that could be sold. _ That 76 individuals or organizations bought bulk quantities of the book, that testimony was received from 19 of them and that of those, 11 had hosted speeches by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> That raised the question of whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was selling books in lieu of accepting speaking fees. Book income is not limited by the rules, but speaking fees are. _ That an investment company, <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, was a `` sham'' to funnel money from <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> to the Wrights, and that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, did little work in return for her $ 18,000-a-year salary _ That because of <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s oil and gas and real estate holdings, he had a `` direct interest in legislation'' before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meaning any benefits worth more than $ 100 received by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as gifts from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> would be improper Committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., declined to criticize <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, saying only that `` he has to represent his client in the way he sees fit'' and that he did not know the content of the briefings But the panel's senior Republican, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, said he had some concerns. `` We extended the courtesy of our committee, which is not required by the rules,'' to <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` When he discusses what took place there, he's in violation of House rules. ... I guess I'm just giving a warning.'' The two most serious remaining issues before the committee, according to sources familiar with the inquiry, are whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used bulk sales of his book to evade limits on outside income from speaking fees, and whether <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had an interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when he paid benefits to the Wrights. The panel already has concluded that there is reason to believe those benefits _ Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary, use of a condominium and use of a Cadillac _ amount to `` gifts'' that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> should have reported, but did not, according to sources.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Stocks Barely Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Wednesday, while stocks gained marginally. The dollar closed at 132.85 yen, up 0.23 yen from Tuesday's closing It opened at 132.68 yen and ranged from 132.60 yen to 132.88 yen during the day. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 250.56 points on Tuesday, edged up another 6.87 points, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 33,256.45. `` The index rose since participants were somewhat reassured because Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said nothing shocking yesterday, but still they are reluctant to purchase actively,'' said <PERSON> Manji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said before parliament that he had received about $ 1 million in donations from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm at the center of a major stock-profiteering and bribery scandal. But he denied taking bribes and continued to reject oposition calls for his resignation. Opposition leaders criticized <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, saying the prime minister had proved nothing, but investors were more or less reassured as he said nothing that might cause a drastic change in Japanese politics, dealers said. `` Some feeling of political uncertainty lingering in the market made trading directionless,'' <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> said. In currency dealings, traders said the dollar-yen rate moved little as market players stepped to the sidelines in the absence of market-affecting incentives. Market sentiment toward a stronger dollar dominated, but the rate is unlikely to move much before Friday, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February and wholesale figures for March are to be released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 The `` promised land'' for Heritage Ministries lies not at the Christian retreat formerly controlled by television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> but for now across the border in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, its president said. The ministry will relocate to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, but ultimately plans to settle in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> announced Tuesday at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> television studios. The ministry has made down payments on two tracts of land in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> totaling more than 100 acres and worth nearly $ 5 million, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Heritage Ministries is the non-profit television ministry spun off from the bankruptcy reorganization of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in August. The ministry and the separate <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is pastor, are based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the 2,200-acre retreat <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> once controlled. `` Amusement is a wonderful thing,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` A family park is a wonderful thing. Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had a wonderful dream but it went awry through mismanagement and misappropriations and for that we have all paid and are paying dearly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> offered to purchase some of the properties it leases for $ 80,000 a month from the former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> corporation, such as the television studio, following bankruptcy proceedings. But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> businessman who bought <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets for $ 65 million in December, was unreceptive, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he informed <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> of the ministry's plans to move on Monday. The ministry will leave <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> by July 1 for a nearly 20-acre site of three lots in south <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. A church on the site will serve as the home for the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 600 adult members, and as the studio for the television ministry, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The ministry also has made a $ 10,000 deposit on 88 acres of undeveloped land in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> worth $ 2.5 million. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the ministry also has an option to purchase an additional 25 acres at the site. The two sites are within miles of the ministry's current headquarters. The ministry's `` more permanent home'' will be in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> is located, but it has not set a timetable for development of the site, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The most important concern for the ministry, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, is raising the money to finance the resettlement. One likely source is $ 5.5 million donated by <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> supporters when the ministry was considering bidding on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s purchase. The ministry plans a campaign this weekend to reach those contributors. `` We believe that most of the money, if not all of it ... will be released to help us relocate and cross the river <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and enter the promised land,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. More contributions could come in from supporters who have waited for the ministry to announce its plans, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned amid revelations that he had a sexual relationship with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and later arranged payments of ministry money to buy her silence. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> began joint operation of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, which includes a hotel and theme park, with bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> on Feb. 13, but has yet to close on the sale.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has agreed to allow four <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints on its border with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> following an exchange of charges and denials at an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and its ally the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> claim <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating international accords by aiding Afghan guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied the allegations but announced Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that it would allow <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints in <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Parachinar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. Most <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats said the few checkpoints would not stem the tide of infiltration across the border. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has just 50 military observers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s government had allowed them to roam the border at will but not set up checkpoints. Afghan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> called for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints amd urged the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to send a mission to the region to investigate his claim that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is committing aggression against <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of waging `` full-fledged war'' and called for an international conference to safeguard <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s sovereignty He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as co-guarantors of a U.N.-mediated Afghan accord, should persuade <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to halt its support of the Afghan insurgents. <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhund </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> foreign affairs official, called the Afghan charges a fabrication. But he told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has agreed to provide a permanent presence along the border to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Then he added: `` Peace and stability in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> can be restored only if power is transferred from the illegal <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime to a broad-based government acceptable to the Afghan people.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the government battle the guerrillas and eventually had more than 100,000 military personnel in the country. Under the U.N.-sponsored accord, the Soviets accepted a withdrawal plan and said the last of its troops had pulled out as of Feb. 15. Millions of Afghan refugees fled into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> over the past decade and the major Afghan rebel groups established their bases along the frontier. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in response to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s complaint, heard only Afghan and Pakistani speakers The meeting was adjourned and another session was to be scheduled after consultations among the 15 council members. No resolution is expected because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is an ally of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and helps support the rebels. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could be expected to veto any measure critical of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of numerous attacks and of involving its forces in fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, including the battle for the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> near the Pakistani border. He also claimed <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is arming and training Afghan rebels and has established 125 training centers on Afghan soil in violation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accords. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> signed the pact in April 1988. It provides for the withdrawal of the Soviet forces and non-interference in the other country's internal affairs. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed as guarantors, but both have continued supplying their respective sides. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> did not directly criticize the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but said: `` The question is why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a big world power, becomes the tool for the implementation of Pakistani policies on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and why should the strategic interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be subordinated to the expansionist designs of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the region.''

 The government says its troops repelled a guerrilla assault on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, killing hundreds of attackers, and denies that insurgents have cut off land shipments to the embattled eastern city. But guerrillas and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said the insurgents controlled major portions of the road connecting <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and that only helicopters flying by night can make the 75-mile trip. `` The regime's army is trying desperately to open the <LOCATION> Kabul-Jalalabad </LOCATION> highway,'' the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said Tuesday. Also Tuesday, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed to allow the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to set up permanent monitoring posts along its border with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as requested by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government troops on Tuesday counterattacked 14,000 U.S.-backed guerrillas around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> after the insurgents bombarded the city with 18,000 shells and rockets Sunday and Monday. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said troops had killed 318 guerrillas by sundown Tuesday and lost just three government soldiers and five civilians. It was not possible to confirm the figures. The capture of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 45 miles west of the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> where the guerrillas are based, would give the insurgents an important foothold and provide their shadow government-in-exile with its first seat inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> maintained that military convoys were still carrying food and arms from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. He said the convoys were not seen leaving the capital because they travel at night. Civilians are not permitted out of their houses during a curfew starting 11 p.m. and ending 4 a.m. Western diplomats in the Pakistani capital of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said Afghan government forces were holding the city and its airport, but guerrilla rockets and artillery make it too dangerous for fixed-wing aircraft. `` The only means of resupply remaining to regime forces is by helicopter, although such flights are increasingly being interdicted by the resistance, even though most of them take place at night,'' said one diplomat on condition of anonymity. `` Indeed, most of the flights are kept busy bringing in medical supplies and evacuating casualties,'' the diplomat said. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed to permit <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers to set up permanent checkpoints along the Afghan-Pakistan border. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> contends aid from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is flowing to the Afghan rebels in violation of a U.N.-mediated accord on non-interference. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies the charges, but its agreement on the additional checkpoints is considered a minor concession. Diplomats said they doubted it would alter the Afghan civil war. The increased presence of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers, who now number just 50 and are split between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, has repeatedly been requested by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several Moslem countries are the main backers of the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in 1978. Soviet military forces entered the war in 1979 and completed a U.N.-negotiated withdrawal Feb. 15.

 An elderly couple were recovering from injuries suffered when their 700-pound hog turned into a crashing boar and went on a rampage in their yard. <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Cato </PERSON>, 89, and his wife <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, 79, have kept the pig in their backyard for four years since he wandered onto the property in this town about 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The pig broke out of his 15-by-30-foot pen Saturday after a fire started in the yard. He gouged Mrs. <PERSON> Cato </PERSON>'s legs and right arm with his 4-inch tusks as the couple tried to get him back in the pen, said <PERSON> Xan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawls </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Brevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, an ambulance was sent to the house after <PERSON> Cato </PERSON> collapsed, Ms. <PERSON> Rawls </PERSON> said, but the pig blocked the doorway and kept paramedics at bay. Animal control officials and sheriff's deputies were called in, and two deputies shot and killed the pig as it charged them. The Catos were treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sebastian </ORGANIZATION>, a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday. They declined to answer a reporter's questions. `` Adult males ca n't be trusted,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, a wild hog expert in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` Some days they are very lovable and take chocolate bars and will roll over and let you scratch them on the stomach. The next day they will slam you up against the fence. You just do n't know what is motivating them.''

<HEAD>Indictment Accuses Northrop Of Falsified Cruise Missile Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government has indicted <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly falsifying test data on cruise missile guidance systems, raising questions whether the strategic nuclear weapon would function in time of war. The aerospace giant and five current or former employees were charged Tuesday with conspiring to defraud the government in the construction of part of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> missile's guidance system and a component of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Harrier fighter jet. The 167-count indictment charged that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and the employees conspired to install parts for the Flight Data Transmitter of the cruise missile that failed to meet government specifications. In addition to the suspect guidance systems, the defendants were accused of falsifying test data on the stability system for the Harrier. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> indictment said the cruise missile data transmitter was required to undergo tests for effectiveness in extreme cold but were not performed. The indictment said defendants falsely certified untested units. In some cases, faulty components were certified as having passed tests, according to the indictment. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said it `` strongly disputes any allegations of criminal behavior'' in the indictments that were announced Tuesday night by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has cooperated fully with the government during its investigation,'' the Century City-based company added in its statement. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> are evaluating evidence on the falsifications to determine if action must be taken to ensure reliability of the air-launched missiles -LRB- ALCMs -RRB-, which are mounted from the wings of B-1B and B-52 bombers, and the stability system for the Harrier jet. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Most bombers must fly over the polar ice cap. ... `` The ALCMs are going to get very cold. It would raise the possibility that a significant number would not work if they were called on to work.'' Between 1981 and 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> produced and shipped about 1,175 flight data transmitters for use in the missiles. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said if the effectiveness of the missiles were called into question, `` It would be one of the more significant -LRB- weapons -RRB- reliability problems in several decades.'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said the indictment was the result of a two-year investigation by a task force that included the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Special Investigations, the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. If convicted of all offenses, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum fine of more than $ 30 million. Each defendant would face maximum prison sentences of five years on each count and fines ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 250,000. Individuals indicted were <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamron </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of the Precision Products Division of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Engler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, formerly a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonsalves </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Glendora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, former manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> department of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Glendora </LOCATION>, formerly quality assurance supervisor for <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <PERSON> Yorba </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, former chief engineer for <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. On the cruise missile project, the indictment charges that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yamron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Engler </PERSON> knew that the flight data transmitter was required to withstand temperatures as low as minus 65 degrees Fahrenheit but supplied parts that froze at temperatures of minus 40 to minus 50 degrees. The Harrier is a high-technology jet fighter that can take off vertically and hover. Between 1982 and 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> produced and shipped 189 rate sensor assemblies for the jet. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> also is the target of five civil lawsuits by former employees who alleged the company falsified test results and cheated the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on the MX missile project. In addition to well-publicized battles with critics of the MX program, the company faces a congressional investigation of allegations of improper payments to South Korean businessmen in an unsuccessful effort to sell its F-20 Tigershark fighter in that country in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> also is the main contractor for the B-2 `` stealth bomber.''

 Contra rebel leaders will meet opposition politicians in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> next month in a bid to field a unity coalition against the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990 elections, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> reported. The opposition newspaper said in its Tuesday editions that directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella organization, will meet with leaders of 14 opposition parties in the capital `` if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> do n't stop them.'' It would be the rebel leaders' first trip to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since June, when talks between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and rebels broke down. Resistance leaders and domestic opposition leaders signed an agreement Monday after meeting in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and pledging to unite to run against the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in February 1990 elections. The document, quoted by <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said the domestic opposition and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders had accepted `` the political electoral path in order to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> FSLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party -RRB-, which will lead to democratization, stable and durable peace, reconciliation and reconstruction of the nation.'' The Resistance, it said, `` reaffirms its disposition to maintain the halt to offensive military operations during the development of a completely free election process in our country.'' The opposition party leaders were to return <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> today to hold a news conference on the accord, party spokesmen said. The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada on Tuesday condemned the attempts at Contra-opposition unification. Barricada displayed a photo of <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> embracing <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. An accompanying editorial said the accord represented `` a tragedy for all these parties that call themselves the internal opposition who have shown themselves to be incapable of administering what little legitimacy they have and risk converting themselves into what they were n't before, an opposition hired by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was a colonel in the National Guard of dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, who was toppled in 1979 in the revolution the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> rode to power. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> later served as a military chief of the Contras, who have been backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels ran out early last year. Contra forces that sought refuge in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after the aid ran out are receiving humanitarian aid. Seven opposition parties hold 35 seats in the 96-member legislature, including the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist-Leninist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have 61 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.

 Unidentified assailants ambushed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military convoy, raking it with gunfire and disabling a jeep with an explosive, but no casualties were reported, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The attack Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was the third this year on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the country. The caravan of 11 jeeps was hit as it carried supplies to troops taking part in military exercises, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>. He said 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and six Honduran soldiers were in the vehicles. `` We do n't know how many people were involved in the attack, but an investigation is in progress,'' said <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but leftist groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Cinchonero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> have attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the past. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said the incident occurred on a road near <LOCATION> Olanchito </LOCATION>, about 125 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the capital. `` There were several gunshots and an explosive device that blew up beneath one of the vehicles,'' said <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>. He said the nature of the device was unknown. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Honduran troops are taking part in a joint exercise to build roads in northern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The exercise started in December and will end in July, with 600 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops rotating in every two weeks. The Honduran armed forces, in a statement, called it a `` criminal attack on members of both armies who are working jointly to create an adequate highway infrastructure to improve living conditions for Hondurans.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Honduran forces are investigating the Tuesday morning attack, a Honduran armed forces statement said. The troops were scheduled to return today to <LOCATION> Enrique </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. At least two soldiers have been killed and six injured in attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the last four years. On Feb. 1, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop convoy was hit by gunfire but no one was injured. The last attack occurred on Feb. 18, when an unidentified assailant hurled a bomb at a passing bus carrying 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. The explosive destroyed the bus and injured three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and two Honduran passers-by.

<HEAD>Mexico Signs $3.6 Billion Debt Assistance Agreement With IMF</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has signed a $ 3.65 billion three-year loan agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to bolster the country's foreign exchange reserves and help spur domestic economic growth. The accord breaks from previous <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> practice by mandating no new austerity measures, said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, struggling to overcome the burden of payments to commercial banks and governments on its $ 107 billion foreign debt, is the developing world's second-largest debtor. Only <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> owes more _ $ 121 billion. Tuesday's agreement is the first from the international lending community since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> outlined a debt-reduction plan on March 10 that he hoped would help ease payment terms on the developing world's $ 1.32 trillion foreign debt. As interest rates have risen worldwide since last year, the higher rates have created additional problems for countries struggling to meet the terms of payments to foreign creditors. Some debtor nations threaten default unless they can arrive at more favorable terms with lenders. Austerity measures imposed by the Venezuelan government at the behest of international lending organizations prompted riots last month in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> that led to the deaths of more than 300 people. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said Tuesday that his country's agreement intends to reverse <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s net outflow of funds and provide investment money to spur economic growth, which was nil last year. By stipulating that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> recognizes <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s need to set its growth priorities first and schedule debt servicing accordingly, <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said the agreement `` is a fundamental change from the past.'' `` The agreement reached with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> constitutes a plain endorsement of the economic strategy of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' he said. That means the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will not require further devaluations of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> peso, as has been called for in previous agreements in an effort to stimulate exports, said one government official on condition of anonymity. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortarihas </PERSON> pressed efforts to cut the outflow of capital needed to revitalize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s stagnant economy. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been expected to be among the first beneficiaries of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, which seeks to entice banks to forgive part of the debt in return for assurances from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that the remaining debt will be paid. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> also announced that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will conclude an agreement this week with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.5 billion in credits to support the government's restructuring programs. In addition, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> shortly expects to obtain $ 500 million in compensatory financing from the fund, <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said. The combined credits `` will be devoted to operations that reduce the debt and its servicing,'' he said. On April 19, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will formally present creditor banks its proposals to reduce the foreign debt's value, cut servicing and obtain additional lending over several years, the treasury chief said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will offer banks the option of exchanging old debt for Mexican bonds that discount debt principal and reduce interest rates, <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> told the private `` 24 Hours'' newscast late Tuesday. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> netted a $ 1.1 billion reduction of debt principal in a bond auction backed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury last year. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> agreement also will promote <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to reach restructuring agreements with the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of creditor government banks. He stressed that Tuesday's pact `` is a new type of agreement that bolsters a strategy of sustained economic growth with price stability,'' a clear reference to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' anti-inflation program. That program has reduced inflation from a record 159.2 percent in 1987 to 52.7 percent in 1988. The government predicts inflation will reach 18 percent this year.

 Many voters are angry that Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> broke his no-tax campaign pledge, but <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> defends the record tax hike and says he could n't be more satisfied with his first three months in office. `` We inherited a state which was in real crisis,'' the Democratic governor said Tuesday. `` I think we well-defined that crisis and with a cooperative effort with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> ... have set forth a legislative program to turn this state around, and we batted about 1,000 percent.'' The $ 392 million tax package is just one of the accomplishments <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> pointed to with pride after the regular legislative session ended last week. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle passed virtually all his major bills, including one calling for a sweeping reorganization of state government, and generally gave him rave reviews for his leadership. It was a dramatic change from the previous four years, in which a <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> dominated by Democrats fought almost constantly with combative Republican Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> in November. `` He's been honest,'' said Republican state Sen. <PERSON> Buffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. `` He's been very actively and personally involved. And I think both on the surface and the deeper you look, the man is trying his absolute best to do what has to be done in this state.'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> inherited a treasury that was millions of dollars in debt because of severe slumps in the coal and steel industries in recent years, which drove up unemployment, and cuts in federal assistance. Despite his campaign pledge, <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> asked the Legislature for the largest tax increase in its history, including a new 6 percent sales tax on food and a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. `` I also said I'd never be a governor who could n't pay his bills,'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said. `` We had the courage and the guts to stand up and ... raise taxes. No one likes to raise taxes and no one likes to pay additional taxes. But it was necessary.'' Many voters apparently did n't appreciate that courage. Some tax protesters who showed up at the Capitol last month carried signs calling for <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s impeachment. A statewide poll conducted in mid-March showed 73 percent of respondents thought <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> broke his campaign promise by pushing for a tax hike within a week of taking office, and two-thirds rated his job performance as just fair or poor. The poll showed <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> would trail <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> by 43 percent to 36 percent if an election were held today. Lawmakers approved <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s plan to consolidate more than 155 state agencies and departments under seven gubernatorially appointed, cabinet-level secretaries. They also approved <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s request to put proposed constitutional amendments before voters in September. One amendment would abolish the elected posts of secretary of state, treasurer and agriculture commissioner and put the jobs under the governor's control Another would place the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> under the governor's control. Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, the only Republican holding statewide office, said <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> was making a grab for power. `` It's the honeymoon express,'' he said. `` Every governor enjoys a period of good will with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. This time it is amplified by the governor's party's overwhelming control of both chambers of the Legislature.'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> says he is n't concerned about the polls or the protests. And <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, one of only four Republicans in the 34-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, says there's plenty of time for anger to ease before <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s term ends in 1992. `` Four years will be enough time to see that he's done the things that needed to be done,'' he said.

 The do n't - drink-and-drive message went <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> this season, with TV stars making references to `` designated drivers'' and occasionally wresting car keys away from The additions were part of a carefully scripted effort to introduce the notion that drinking and driving is socially unacceptable from the powerful podium of prime-time television, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of our goals was to increase public awareness just of the concept of designated driver to introduce it into the American lexicon,'' said <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON>, assistant dean of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and director of its <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION>. Scenes varied from devious <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' sleeping off a night on the town before heading for <LOCATION> Southfork </LOCATION> to `` Family Ties'' character <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> volunteering to drive friends home from an evening jaunt. The message has been written into 32 television programs since the season began last fall, including an entire episode of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s highly rated `` Growing Pains'' to be broadcast tonight, <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> said `` You do n't change social norms overnight, but we're off to a good start,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, begun in late 1987, is trying to harness the influence of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and Madison Avenue in making drinking and driving as socially passe as smoking cigarettes. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> researchers made a low-key appeal to television executives to write in occasional references to designated drivers. The proposal was endorsed by the board of the Writer's Guild of <LOCATION> America-West </LOCATION>. Having characters casually refer to picking a designated driver, someone who stays sober to drive the drinkers home, reinforces what is already becoming accepted partying behavior, <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> said. `` Our role really is as a catalyst,'' he said. `` Producers, like the public, they're primed and ready to respond to this issue.'' The message was broadcast in various ways this season. On one episode of CBS' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' a bedraggled <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> explains to his young son that he could n't drive home the night before because he'd been drinking. Of course, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> is n't telling the whole truth about his nocturnal adventures, but the message is clear.

 Seven children and two women who died in a house fire apparently had little warning because a first-floor smoke detector in an empty apartment did n't work, authorities said. The victims were sleeping on the second floor, said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>'s fire administration manager. `` By the time they were aware their home was on fire,'' he said, `` the fire had gotten a very good start and their means of getting out of the structure had already been cut off due to the heat and smoke.'' Fire swept through the rented, two-story dwelling about 2 a.m. Tuesday, killing nine people and injuring two adults and one child. Three families lived in the house in a working-class section of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, population 130,000. `` I came home and I saw the lights and awakened my husband,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. `` We came running out and by the time we came out, the house was already engulfed in flames.'' Later Tuesday, police arrested <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, 34, and charged him with criminal trespass for living in the first floor of the building without permission, said Fire Chief G. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> was at the building Monday night, and left at 11:30 p.m., <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, who was not charged in the fire, was apparently homeless and sometimes stayed at the house, the fire chief said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> was being held at the <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. Smoke detectors were found in the building, but the first-floor detector was powered by electricity, which had been cut on the first floor April 4 because bills went unpaid, said <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>. Electricity worked on the building's second floor, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. Officials were unsure whether the second-floor detector had sounded. <PERSON> Joos </PERSON> said local and state codes require smoke detectors in apartments and homes. `` Landlord and tenant both share the responsibility of making sure that not only the smoke detector exists, but making sure that they work and are functioning correctly,'' he said. The fire started on the first floor near the door, and investigators were examining a gas heater, said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` At this point we still do n't have any indication that this is a suspicious or an arson fire,'' he said. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said as many as 15 firefighters will undergo psychological counseling to help them cope with stress linked to the deaths. `` We're going to try to talk to all the guys and see if there's any problem,'' he said `` If we find out they're suffering, we wo n't have them back -LRB- yet -RRB-.'' The cause of the deaths appeared to be smoke inhalation, said Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>. The children ranged in age from 2 months to 10 years. At <ORGANIZATION> Franciscan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 14, were in fair condition today, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzbee </PERSON> identified the dead as <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, 20, and her children, <PERSON> Ashly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, 1, and <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, 3; <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 27, and her children, <PERSON> Carlyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 2, <PERSON> Arnisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Tenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 10.

 The city's first black school chief hung on to his job by one vote, but opponents of <LOCATION> Laval </LOCATION> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> vowed to continue working to oust him. Bitterness from the 7-6 vote Tuesday night by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spilled over to the announcement that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s contract would be renewed. As committee President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> tried to move on to other agenda items after the announcement, committee member <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON> suddenly took command of the microphone. `` We're going to do everything in our power to see to it that we get a new superintendent,'' <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he was delighted with the renewal but acknowledged there had been problems during his tenure. `` I do n't think anyone was expecting a real endorsement,'' the 53-year-old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native said after the announcement. `` The issue was whether or not we could continue the progress we've made.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s arrival in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> four years ago to operate the country's oldest public school system was heralded as the healing of racial wounds that had festered since the first days of federally ordered desegregation in the mid-1970s. But the honeymoon has come to an end in recent months, with critics increasingly denouncing what they call <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s `` autocratic'' style Committee member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>, who supports <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said it was everyone's duty to try to make the uneasy union work. `` I hope they realize that personal vendetta have to be put aside in the interest of the school system,'' he said. `` We have to think of the kids first.'' But <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON> said he and other dissenters would show their displeasure by voting down <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s program proposals and making an intense effort to lobby the swing vote necessary to oust the superintendent. `` There's going to be some troublemaking,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis-Mullen </PERSON>, a committee member and one of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s fiercest detractors. The committee, which announced its decision after deliberating about two hours behind closed doors, offered <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> a contract without an increase to his $ 95,000 salary and with performance reviews every six months. `` It's not a working situation,'' <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON> said. `` I do n't see how Dr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> thinks he'll be able to get anything done. `` If I were him, I'd see the handwriting on the wall ... and bow out,'' he said. `` He is not the man for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> job.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said some people who oppose <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> `` are afraid they're going to be attacked for being racist. But black leaders have come out against this man. It's his approach. He's not a communicator, not a motivator.'' The system has become increasingly black since the early 1970s, when white students began moving in droves from public to private schools. There are 59,000 students, 24 percent of them white, enrolled in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s public schools today as compared with 96,000 in 1972, when 60 percent of students were white. Supporters have said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is a tireless worker who regularly puts in 12-hour days and deserves a fair shot at turning the troubled system around, but detractors claim he has n't dealt effectively with high dropout rates and low test scores.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> fended off an upstart challenger to win an unprecedented fifth term in a squeaker election that almost had him facing a runoff. `` Never take anything for granted,'' the 71-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> told supporters today after his narrow victory. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> _ the city's first black mayor, an ex-cop and son of a sharecropper _ needed at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a June 6 runoff. Early today, he held more than 52 percent of the vote with 98.4 percent of the city's precincts reporting. At one point, he had dropped to 50 percent of Tuesday's non-partisan vote, in which turnout was less than 20 percent. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s nearest finisher among the 10 candidates, freshman Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, conceded after midnight. `` A little more time and more money, there could have been a difference,'' said <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who gathered only $ 150,000 for his campaign funds versus <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s $ 2 million. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who remained out of sight most of Tuesday night, declared victory early today. `` I am grateful for the people who gave us this victory,'' he told supporters at the Biltmore Hotel. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> quickly pledged to renew the battle against drugs and gangs that plague the nation's second largest city. With 98.4 percent of the 2,353 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> had 152,373 of the vote, or 52.13 percent. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> had 81,747 votes, or 28 percent; and former county supervisor and television commentator <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> drew 44,186 votes, or 15 percent. Only 16.5 percent, or 384,000 of the city's 1.9 million registered voters, went to the polls to elect the officials to lead <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> during the next four years. A poll taken recently by The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> showed 78 percent of Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable impression of the Democratic mayor. That's led <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> to be dubbed the `` Teflon mayor'' because he's apparently not being blamed for the city's mounting urban problems. Other candidates included a socialist oil field worker and a singer-dancer who used to cavort in a green bikini across the street from City Hall every day. The victory by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who has been mayor 16 years, puts him in a position to oversee <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> into the early 1990s as the population swells past 3 million people, with more than 70 different languages spoken. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> had been expected to win another four-year term despite a city attorney's office announcement of an ethics investigation of him after learning he had performed consulting work with <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which did business with the city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has returned the $ 18,000 in fees he was paid by the bank and called the charges politically motivated at election time. Pollsters and would-be opponents such as City Councilman <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON> agreed that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s low-key image kept him from being linked in voters' minds with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' growing problems, including criminal gangs, illegal drug trade, traffic congestion and a failing sewage system. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sharecropper and the grandson of slaves, was first elected mayor in 1973. He has run twice for governor as a Democrat, losing in 1982 and 1986 to Republican Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. A student and track star at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> entered public service as a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police lieutenant, and later was elected to the City Council. He was defeated in his first run at mayor in a bitter 1969 race against incumbent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yorty </PERSON> that critics said was tinged with racism.

<HEAD>Suburb Where Woman Shot Students Bans Handguns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Handguns are now banned in this affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, where the quiet was shattered 11 months ago when a deranged woman went on a shooting rampage in an elementary school. After only minutes of debate, <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 6-0 Tuesday night to adopt an ordinance banning the private ownership of handguns. `` I hope this will make <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> a better place, and we will leave a better heritage for all of you,'' Village President <PERSON> Clarine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told a group of young children who gave flowers to council members after the vote. The children, their parents and others pushed for passage of the ban. On May 20, 1988, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> walked into a <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> elementary school classroom, killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded several other children. She later wounded a young man at his home, then killed herself. She carried three handguns she bought in neighboring <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>. `` It is almost a year, and I am satisfied that this has had thoughtful consideration,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, referring to the ban. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralli </PERSON>, 9, a fourth-grader, said he was `` mad that <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> wounded kids and killed one in school. I just wanted to ban handguns.'' Board member <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said she would rather see state and national laws banning handguns, `` but I do n't foresee this in the near future.'' `` That's why we have to start on the local level,'' Ms. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. The vote came a week after <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> residents, in a nonbinding referendum, voted 2,125 to 1,407 in favor of banning handguns in the town, north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Schoolchildren made posters and signs, urging people to vote for the ban. The new ordinance bans the sale and possession of handguns. It excludes police officers, gun collectors and security guards. Violators face a fine of $ 300 to $ 500 for a first offense. The measure, which takes effect immediately, calls for the voluntary surrender of nonexempt guns to the Police Department within three months. <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> has few crimes. Last year, the village of 13,000 had no reported robberies or rapes. Police have n't fired a gun for at least a year, and before the <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> incident, the last homicide was in 1957. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zangrilli </PERSON>, a resident of Oak Park and a national board member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that such a ban was unconstitutional and would turn ordinary citizens into lawbreakers. Five other <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs have handgun bans, including <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, which in 1981 became the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> community to prohibit the weapons. <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> and Oak Park followed suit, while Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s shooting rampage provided the impetus for two northern suburbs, <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, to prohibit handguns State lawmakers recently introduced legislation that calls for a mandatory waiting period before all handgun sales.

<HEAD>Military Says It Will Intervene Again If `Order' Is Disrupted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander and leader of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since 1973, says the military will intervene again if `` order'' is not maintained by the next government. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military is preparing to surrender power after 16 years of authoritarian rule. In October, voters rejected a military proposal to extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s term until 1997. An open presidential election now is scheduled for Dec. 14 with the winner to take office on March 11. The 73-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, speaking Monday night in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, said the armed forces must `` guard the constitutional order.'' `` That obliges us to make sure, without hesitation, that the sons of this land will not see the efforts of these years destroyed,'' he said. `` We will continue to work to ensure that those seeking political power are authentic democrats, who defend the model of a free society.'' Army Gen. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, commander of the military academy, delivered a stronger message Monday to hundreds of non-commissioned officers. `` If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces have the duty to restore it, using ... all the necessary means,'' he said. <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said civilians must understand `` the role of the armed forces,'' and that role is not one of a policeman watching the country `` but to support the reign of law and the institutional order.'' Opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls the institutional order, which is based on a 1980 constitution approved in a referendum. Opponents have centered their criticism on two issues: A constitutional article that allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the heads of the other military branches to remain as commanders until 1998, and the creation of a military-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to `` represent'' its views on crucial matters. No significant progress has been reported in negotiations between the government and opposition on possible constitutional changes. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> authorized the negotiations but said he would not allow changes in key articles.

<TEXT>
 Wild <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON> was shot in the head during a poker game in Deadwood more than a century ago, but the city's voters have bet that restoring gambling will give a shot in the arm to the gold-rush town's economy. Residents voted 690-230 Tuesday to allow poker, blackjack and slot machines, with the city's cut of the proceeds to be used to restore and preserve buildings in the historic <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> community of 2,000. An amendment to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Constitution last year provided that gambling limited to $ 5 bets would be permitted in Deadwood if 60 percent of the city's voters approved it. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is the third state to allow casino gambling, joining <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Melodee </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Deadwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> You </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said legalized gambling should boost the economy, increase tourism, create jobs and help hold down property taxes. `` But let's all remember it's first and foremost a funding mechanism for historic preservation,'' she said. `` That's what it started out as. That's what it's always been.'' Supporters hope the games can begin this summer, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, owner of the 85-year-old <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON>. He said the restoration of gambling is about as important as the arrival of the first train in 1890. `` It's here, and we want to all jump on the train and ride this thing for the betterment of the city of Deadwood and the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' he said. About 50 supporters of the measure gathered Tuesday night in the hotel lobby, which is guarded by a bust of <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>. But their celebration was subdued by the outcome of the mayoral election. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, a gambling supporter, ran into trouble in his re-election bid. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> finished second in a three-way race, and now will face first-place finisher <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberlander </PERSON> in a runoff in two weeks. Some residents quietly opposed a return to gambling on moral grounds, and argued that the games would n't provide that much of an economic boost. `` I do n't know that I'm as disappointed as much as I'm hurt by this, when people are n't looking at moral issues here,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadrick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Deadwood. Supporters think gambling will help make the area a final destination for tourists, instead of just a stop on the way to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rushmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>, which is about 50 miles away. They have predicted gambling could attract at least 200,000 additional tourists a year. It also could provide $ 500,000 annually to further promote tourism by restoring an <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> look to the city founded when miners flooded the area afer the 1876 discovery of gold in <LOCATION> Deadwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION>. Before gambling begins, a <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will be appointed to write regulations. Deadwood owes much of its tourism reputation to <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal and frontiersman who was shot in the back of the head in 1876 during a poker game in a saloon called No. 10. Legend has it he was holding a pair each of aces and eights, known since as the `` dead man's hand.'' Gambling has been illegal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for about 100 years, but illegal games flourished openly in Deadwood saloons as recently as the 1930s and'40s. A law passed by the Legislature this year gave the state 40 percent of any gambling taxes and other revenues, with <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to get a 10 percent cut. The city of Deadwood was left with all the tax and fee revenue remaining after the expenses of regulating the games are paid.

 Residents of this border city said today they hope they can ward off a stigma that could be attached to their community after the cult mutilations of at least 12 people. `` It is not fair if people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> try to judge all of us just because a few people committed these atrocities,'' <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Pancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant, said this morning. `` Those people may not even be from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. `` We do n't really know what the reaction of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be, but we are very concerned and we will tell the tourists that 99.9 percent of the people here are good and that it only takes one or two to give the others the bad name.'' Five men have been arrested in connection with the slayings, Mexican authorities said. Authorities on Tuesday announced the arrests after discovering several graves at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, outside of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. The graves contained remains of 12 bodies, including that of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> premedical student who disappeared from the streets of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> during spring break on March 14. Authorities said the victims, most of them still unidentified, were sacrificed in a voodoo ritual intended to ward off harm to the suspects during drug-smuggling activities. The streets of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> were quiet early this morning, a day after the revelations hit the newspapers and television airwaves. Resident <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cistkovit </PERSON> said many residents worried about <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> after his parents, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, offered a $ 15,000 reward seeking information about his disappearance. `` We put ourselves in the parents' position. We really felt for them,'' she said. `` They should give those guys the death penalty because it's horrible what they did. They should hang. They do n't deserve to live. However, she worried that publicity about the case could cast a dark shadow on the city. With a month before summer vacationers begin their annual summer descent on <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, some residents said the revelations will not greatly affect tourism. `` This town is a tranquil place. There are some fights every once in a while and there are some faith healers here, too, but nothing like this has ever happened and it's new to us,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, a restaurant manager. `` This may take a little time to pass, but we think it wo n't hurt us too much.''

<HEAD>Tom Bradley: `Teflon Mayor' Wins Fifth Term</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-LA Mayor, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, called the `` Teflon mayor'' because the blame for the city's problems has n't stuck to him in the past, the timing for a re-election bid could n't have been much worse. Gang-related murders are on the rise, traffic congestion is horrendous, the sewage system is failing and there's problems with smog, housing and homelessness. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' first black mayor, won election to an unprecedented fifth term Tuesday but by a far less of a margin than published polls had predicted. Early today, he held more than 52 percent of the vote with 98.4 percent of the city's precincts reporting. He needed at least 50 percent to avoid a June 6 runoff. His nine rivals were not well known and voter turnout was less than 20 percent. A recent poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> showed 78 percent of Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable impression of the Democratic mayor. Pollsters had said that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s low-key image helped him. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, mayor for 16 years, a city councilman and a policeman before that, may be one of the most private public persons in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` There's a mystery about him that I do n't know if anyone will ever crack,'' former press deputy <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> once said. `` I've spent more time with him than anyone, including his wife, during the I still do n't understand him.'' His political powers as mayor include an ability to heal his wounds almost overnight and a quick recovery when he slips. He's slipped twice in runs for governor. In his first try, he lost to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> in 1982 by just 1.2 percent. Some said voter racism shaved the ballots <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> needed to win, but he refused to blame prejudice for losing the campaign, except in oblique references years later. With a monotonal speech delivery and a decided dislike for public feuding, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is a far cry from such contemporaries as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. But at 6-foot-4 and still bearing an athletic trim in his eighth decade, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> can afford to dispense with histrionics and arm-waving to get things done. His political power, observers say, lies in his attention to detail _ he takes notes on potholes while riding through the city _ and his refusal to delegate authoity to staffers. Their role is to do his bidding, and do it quickly. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s executive assistant, has said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> sees 99.9 percent of the paperwork that passes through his office, down to gripe letters from constituents. His 1987 appointment calendar, opened to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, shows him in unrelenting motion, working 16 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week. He went to 512 social engagements that year, including birthday parties, bar mitzvahs, weddings, pancake breakfasts and the opening of a fast-food chicken restaurant. Those appearances are another key for <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> _ his ability in a city of more than 3 million to appear to be everywhere at once. He does n't even have to be in some spots to have his presence felt. Busts of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> stare at visitors at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Terminal </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Produce Mart, all tributes to the revitalization and building of the city for which <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has taken credit without the usual hoopla. He also brought the profitable 1984 Summer Olympics to the city, and has encouraged <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' role as an important center of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> trading.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stockbroker was sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to make full restitution for insider-trading based on advance knowledge of market sensitive Business Week articles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> to two years in prison Tuesday but suspended all but six months because <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> was cooperating with federal investigators. The judge turned down a defense lawyer's request that <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> not be sent to jail, saying the former broker was `` motivated by greed, pure and simple.'' <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, 34, of Old Lyme, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty last year to a single count of wire fraud. He could have been sentenced to a maximum five years in prison and fined $ 250,000. <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> began working at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, office in 1986. He was fired last July after the firm discovered he had been obtaining advance copies of Business Week from workers at a printing plant.

The judge also ordered <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> to make full restitution of an amount to be determined by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The government contends that <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, who now works as a carpenter, made some $ 118,000 in profits from more than 120 trades between May 1986 and July 1988, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to a fraud count in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and is due to be sentenced there on Thursday, said <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team arrived in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today for the fifth joint field investigation to account for American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said. The 10 specialists flew from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for the 18-day mission, which is expected to be the longest of its type since the war ended, said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, the spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Previous investigations were limited to about 10 days each. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators, including forensic scientists, are from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, both based in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. They will work with officials of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Office For Seeking Missing Personnel. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said earlier that most of the investigative work this month would focus on the area of <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION>, a major port 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION> is in what was <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported in the war the against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> north. The Marines who splashed ashore there in March 1965 were the first American combat troops to set foot on the Asian mainland since the end of the Korean conflict. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew in 1973 and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fell to Communist forces in April 1975. In the joint field missions, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Vietnamese investigators interview villagers and inspect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane crash sites to try to resolve `` discrepancy cases'' that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> considers top priority. These are cases that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say Vietnamese authorities should have information on, including cases of airmen who survived crashes but failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> previously announced that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on April 27 would return 21 sets of remains that may be those of missing Americans. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned large numbers of remains since August 1987, when it agreed to accelerate cooperation on the issue in return for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s help in encouraging private humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. More than 1,700 Americans are listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and others are unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The pro-Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> claims to have found the remains of some of the 83 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen missing there, but a senior <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> official last week there was `` no progress'' in arranging their repatriation. <PERSON> Uch </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, repeated his government's demand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government receive the remains directly and not through intermediaries. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused to do that and instead has requested assistance from an international organization because it does not recognize the government, which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after invading the country in late 1978. `` There should be negotiations between governments, not between this government and private groups,'' <PERSON> Uch </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiman </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> with two <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalists. `` We do n't seem to have a positive signal from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government ... regarding the return of the remains of the MIAs,'' he said. In February, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told a former American aid official that about 10 percent of the 83 Americans listed as MIA have been found.

<HEAD>Commander Says Soviet Sub Crew Gave Up Too Late</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More sailors might have survived the sinking of a Soviet submarine off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> if they had realized sooner that the vessel could not be saved, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> commander said in an interview published today. `` People did n't think about retreat, they were sure they would be able to save the ship, and so part of the submarine's crew did n't get a chance to use the life-saving equipment on board,'' Adm. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. The nuclear-powered submarine, carrying two nuclear-tipped missiles, caught fire and sank Friday, killing 42 of its crew of 69. The Soviet navy plans to raise the ship from its resting place 4,950 feet deep to determine the exact cause of the disaster, Soviet television reported. <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> was quoted as telling the newspaper that the ship's logbook has been recovered along with many other documents. He said it was clear the construction of `` certain life-saving devices'' on board must be improved, but final conclusions about what caused the accident and its high death toll will be made by a government commission. Soviet officials say there is no danger of radiation leakage from the submarine because the crew shut down its reactors and neither of its torpedoes was armed for combat. The submarine's captain, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanin </PERSON>, pulled a sailor through a smoke-filled hatch and then died as he struggled to reach his crew, according to Soviet media reports. Some survivors waited for rescue in freezing waters for an hour and a half. Only 19 of the 42 bodies have been recovered. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said a short circuit probably caused the fire as the submarine was heading to port after a long voyage.

 A bomb exploded this morning in a van parked outside a border police station, killing a female shop assistant and injuring at least 30 people, police said. At least 24 civilians were hospitalized, some of them with serious injuries, and six police officers were slightly injured in the blast in the County Down seaport of <LOCATION> Warrenpoint </LOCATION>, said Inspector <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The town is less than a mile from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Police said the bomb went off without warning just before 10 a.m., heavily damaging the police station and nearby buildings in the town center. The van was parked outside a construction company yard adjoining the station, and the blast ignited nearby gas cylinders. `` It started a really big fire with thick, black smoke. It was chaotic for a time,'' said one resident, <PERSON> Philomena </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> which has targeted the security forces in its campaign to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Gunmen seized the van from a family who were held captive overnight in their home on the town's outskirts, police said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the bombing occurred without warning. However, nine minutes after the explosion, an anonymous caller to a hospital in nearby <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> warned that a bomb would go off. Several more warnings were given later, indicating the bomb went off prematurely, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> party, said `` people who carry out this sort of attack listen to nobody. They simply have a murderous desire in their hearts to kill.'' The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite the province, where Protestants outnumber <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> 3 to 2, with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killed 18 British army soldiers in an ambush outside <LOCATION> Warrenpoint </LOCATION> on Aug. 27, 1979.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Ratu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamisese </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON>, the architect of independence in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, announced today he will retire. The 68-year-old <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> said he expects to quit politics in December before <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> returns to full parliamentary democracy, two years after the island nation suffered the first of two military coups. He has been dogged by ill-health for the past year and made several visits to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for treatment. As befitting his senior chiefly status and 6-foot-6-inch stature, <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> has wielded immense influence in the region. He is revered as the elder statesman of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and is known as `` the Old Man.'' He was appointed by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to lead <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> to independence, and other nations like <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> followed his lead. <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> leads the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and has been prime minister since 1970. His rule in the racially divided country was interrupted when the Indian-backed coalition party of <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON> defeated him in the 1987 general election, which triggered the first of two military coups. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s population of 715,000 is almost evenly divided between ethnic Melanesian Fijians and Indians, the descendants of British-indentured sugar plantation laborers. <PERSON> Mara </PERSON>'s unexpected announcement to a meeting of government department heads ended speculation he might extend his leadership of the interim administration formed by coup leader Maj.-Gen. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> said he staged two coups _ in May and September 1987 _ to protect the political rights of indigenous Fijians against a growing Indian population. He asked <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> to return as prime minister while a new constitution is negotiated to enshrine those rights. <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> gave no reason for his retirement. He said simply, `` My term of office comes to an end in December this year and it is my intention to retire.''

<TEXT>
 Police today charged a Jewish leader with manslaughter in the death of an Arab shop owner. Soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> reportedly shot and wounded at least six Palestinians. Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> was charged with manslaughter, causing bodily harm in aggravated circumstances and intentionally damaging property, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Etty </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON>. If convicted, he faces 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> is accused of killing <PERSON> Kayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 42, after a rock-throwing incident Sept. 30, 1988 in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. According to prosecutors, <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> got out of his car, fired in the air with his pistol, and then shot the shoe shop owner as he stood outside his store with a customer. The customer was wounded. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> also allegedly overturned vegetable and fruit carts and damaged goods inside <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> stores. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, reached by telephone at <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Romano </LOCATION>, a Jewish enclave in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, said he had not been officially informed of the charges and had no immediate response. The Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, 54, is known as an extremist leader of a religious Jewish movement to settle the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied lands along with 1.7 million Palestinians. An uprising against Israeli rule, which began in December 1987, has killed at least 423 Palestinians and 18 Israelis. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, merchants closed their stores today to protest an incident Monday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in which a Jewish man fired an Uzi submachine gun on a group of Arabs. One Arab was killed and three were wounded, and the killer escaped. An anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of the extremist Sicarites group, named after ancient Jewish assassins active nearly 2,000 years ago. Police today released three Jewish men it detained Tuesday on suspicion of being linked to the attack, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON> said. He said police distributed a composit drawing of the main suspect. A total of five men, four Jews and one Arab, have been detained for questioning in connection with the shootings, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehudai </PERSON> said. All five have all been freed, he said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, about 100 Palestinian youths built barricades and burned tires in narrow streets leading to the Church of Nativity. The masked youths clashed with troops who fired tear gas and rubber bullets, an Arab reporter said. One woman was injured by a rubber bullet.

 Riverboat gambling fell three votes short of approval in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but the measure's backers are n't ready to fold. `` We'll take a look at it overnight and talk again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnould </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>CALUMET CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has overturned the firing of a police officer who failed to break into an apartment where a girl was being raped. Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that Patrolman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, who waited nearly 30 minutes to go inside during the 1987 attack, `` could reasonably have made the judgment call to not crash the door based on the information he had.'' `` We do n't want policemen to believe that they have to take a position of: ` Do n't wait, draw your guns and crash the door, or your job's on the line,''' the judge said. Police Chief <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> said <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, 40, will be back on the job Monday. Though the 12-year-old victim's mother begged police to go inside, <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> and two other officers waited nearly a half hour before rescuing the girl. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, the senior officer at the scene, said he waited for the landlord to arrive with a key because he feared the girl and her 10-year-old brother might be killed if police forced their way in. `` I could n't have lived with that,'' <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> said. `` No matter what judgment call you make, the department can say you were wrong. They were n't there, and I have to live with it.'' A fourth officer later arrived, entered the apartment through an unlocked back door and arrested a suspect, who is awaiting trial. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> was dismissed a year ago by the city Fire and <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The two other officers were suspended for up to three weeks. `` I think the judge is going to get a lot of heat and rightly so,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a lawyer for the girl's family. `` The message, that is very dangerous for the public, is: ` Who do you call when you ca n't call the police?''' The girl's family declined comment. The family is suing <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> and three other officers. The judge upheld one charge against <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> _ late filing of a report _ but noted that the officer could not be fired for such an infraction. He sent the case back to the commission for consideration of a lesser penalty.

 A plane loaded with medical supplies and toys took off for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> today in a charity drive that began with an appeal for spoons. `` It started with 100 spoons and now we're well over 130 boxes,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 cargo plane left <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> with almost 3,000 pounds of supplies for the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Colony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, visited the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation in December to return a 3-year-old boy the couple had housed while he was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for surgery. The Tomaszewskis are foster parents for Heal The Children, an organization based in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, that arranges for Third World children to receive medical care in this country. During her visit, Mrs. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> went to the children's hospital, which was so ill-equipped that patients with severe cuts had to bring their own thread for stitches `` Instead of my eyes just filling with tears, my heart filled with ` I have to do something,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> said. `` When you see children hurting or hungry or so sad, it's a human instinct.'' A nun at the hospital said the children needed metal spoons that could be sterilized so they would n't get sick from eating with their hands. Mrs. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> went home with pictures of the hospital and started asking for help. Individuals and community groups responded, and the couple's home quickly began filling up with spoons, baby cribs, linens, an examination table, a microscope, bandages, stethoscopes, toys, clothes and vitamins. `` Everybody was more than eager to help with the spoons. I think we ended up with 500 spoons along with medical supplies,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> said. The supplies eventually were moved to a warehouse at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> works as a quartermaster.

Mrs. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> said she has sent a message about the shipment to the nun, who had been pessimistic that any supplies would reach the hospital. `` We've arranged for the chamber of commerce over there to bring her to the airport,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tomaszewski </PERSON> said. `` I know that her eyes are going to fall out of her head.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., charged today that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> improperly used a book promotional fund to further his ambition for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership position <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who filed a formal complaint against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee Tuesday, made the accusation against the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> during an appearance on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has cooked up a book scheme that has collected him $ 105,000 that he has used to travel around the country to campaign for Republican leader,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. `` He has not reported it as either'' a contribution or a gift. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said his 1984 book, and the limited partnership set up to promote it, were legitimite enterprises, unlike <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' which is the subject of an ethics committee investigation initiated by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. `` We had a real book with a real publisher bought by real people,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` He had a phony book with a phony publisher bought by lobbyists.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, in announcing the filing of his ethics complaint Tuesday, characterized <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> as `` a congressional <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> who condemns sin while committing hypocrisy.'' The complaint, which lists 10 alleged violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, was filed as the ethics committee neared the conclusion of its deliberations on whether to bring charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` If you have a picnic, flies come to the watermelon,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, when asked about the timing of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint. `` We're in the middle of an exciting period and Mr. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> decided this was the right moment for him to do something. Under House rules, the filing of the complaint will force the ethics panel, known formally as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, to vote on whether to launch a preliminary investigation of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. The chairman and ranking Republican must place the complaint before the panel within 30 days or it comes up automatically at the next meeting. The complaint centers on a limited partnership created to promote the book, `` Window of Opportunity,'' a conservative view of the future written by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. The partnership had 21 investors who put up $ 5,000 each to promote the book, in exchange for a promise of half of the profits that normally would have gone to the publisher. The publisher, however, lost money on the book and the investors got a tax writeoff. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who has denied any wrongdoing with the book deal, said Tuesday the partnership was his wife's responsibility and `` I do n't have any control over that. But he said he is preparing detailed answers to 40 written questions about the book deal that have been submitted to his office by Democratic congressmen and reporters since the existence of the partnership was disclosed in news reports last month. He did not say when those answers would be ready. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said his wife, who has acknowledged receiving less than $ 10,000 from the partnership for setting up the deal and coordinating the promotional effort, `` resents the implication'' in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint that she was used to funnel money to him in violation of House rules. He said she has contacted an attorney to determine if she has grounds for legal action. In addition to the promotional deal, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the book involved a standard royalty contract in which he and his wife each received 3 percent royalties and <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> 2 percent. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the payments <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> characterizes as royalties do not fit the definition in House rules because of the unique promotional deal associated with the book. Consequently, he argued, those payments are not exempt from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule limiting outside earned income, as royalties are. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> also alleged that the promotional deal amounted to four apparent violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limitations on gifts, one instance of possible conversion of campaign funds to personal use, two possible instances of conversion of government resources to personal use, one apparent violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> financial disclosure rules and one apparent violation of the campaign finance law.

 A jury considering the bribery case against three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> executives charged in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> corruption case resumed deliberations today after failing to reach a verdict in two days. The four women and eight men informed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> late Tuesday that they had not come to a decision after a total of 20 hours of deliberations. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he would give the jury new instructions today if they were having problems with the charges. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, three former vice presidents of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud in the first case brought to trial since the government `` Ill Wind'' investigation into fraud and kickbacks at the Pentagon began nearly three years ago. Kaub is also charged with two counts of filing false statements. The case involves what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to bribe a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official for information about a $ 24 million contract that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> obtained in July 1987 to build hand-held radar test sets. The government claims the defendants knew that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a private consultant hired by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, was paying bribes to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official. Both <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, have pleaded guilty in the case and are cooperating with government. But the defendants said they did n't know <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> had done anything illegal. Kaub, <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was hired for $ 10,000 for his expertise in November 1985. He was promised $ 150,000 if <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> won the radar contract, which it did. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was paid about $ 18,000 before the payments stopped when the Ill Wind case was made public.

<HEAD>Doctor Suspended At Austrian Hospital Where Patients Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City authorities today suspended the director of the hospital department where four assistant nurses have confessed to killing at least 49 patients in the past six years. The suspension followed mounting criticism of the chief doctor's conduct during a police investigation last year at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lainz </LOCATION> hospital, where elderly patients reportedly were killed by overdoses of medicine or by forcing water into their lungs Senior police investigator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said Monday that police met `` a wall of silence'' at the hospital during the probe. A police report says the department head, Dr. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> had declined to give police the name of a second doctor, who alerted <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> to suspicions about the killings after talking with a Chilean-born nurse's assistant. The four assistant nurses claim they engaged in `` mercy killings,'' but police said the methods they used made that motive unlikely. The Neue <ORGANIZATION> Kronen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s largest circulation tabloid, said today that if <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> and the second doctor `` had not kept quiet, it would fairly certainly have been possible to stop the series of murders a year ago. `` As it was, however, the sadistic nurses could kill another 22 people,'' the newspaper added. Police have not confirmed media reports that 22 of the 49 people killed were slain in the last year alone. Mayor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilk </PERSON> said he was suspending <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON>, head of the first medical department at <LOCATION> Lainz </LOCATION> hospital, `` on the grounds of the results to date of the police investigations.'' He declined further comment. <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacher </PERSON>, chief of the city's health department, said <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> was suspended because of `` lingering lack of clarity'' over the investigation. <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> consistently has defended his role in the investigation and the conduct of officials in his department at the <LOCATION> Lainz </LOCATION> hospital, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s fourth largest, since the first word of the killings on Friday. The doctor and other hospital officials declined comment today. The Chilean-born nurse's assistant, <PERSON> Dorah </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrada-Avendano </PERSON>, was questioned by police Tuesday and arrested after she admitted to witnessing one of the killings, <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said. But he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he would try to free the woman because `` she has really helped the police.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferrada-Avendano </PERSON> knew of killings at the hospital two or three years before she told the unidentified doctor of her suspicions last year, <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said on television Tuesday. He described her as a single parent who as a foreigner was afraid of losing her job if she went to police. A former patient at the hospital who knows the woman, now an Austrian citizen, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> she feared political persecution if forced to return to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Assistant nurses <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, 25, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Leidorf </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Waltraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 30, have been in custody since Friday. <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> was detained Sunday. None of the women has been charged. Police said the four women confessed they killed at least 49 patients and that Ms. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> admitted killing 39 of them. Pesendorfer is the first doctor or official suspended because of the mass killings.

 Temperatures plunged to record lows across the Southeast today for the second day in a row, dropping below freezing as far south as the central Gulf states and damaging fruit crops in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Low temperature records were tied or broken at more than 20 cities from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, including 15 degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; 32 at <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; 34 at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; 41 at <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; 40 at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; 55 at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and 24 at <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, peaches, plums and strawberries were the hardest hit as the cold snap that sent temperatures below freezing Monday night showed few signs of letting up. Lows in the state this morning included 25 at <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, 25 at <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> and 26 at <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, all records. `` I feel like probably 90 percent of what I looked at were gone,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswalt </PERSON>, an assistant agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, after inspecting a plum orchard Tuesday. `` These plums were anywhere from a quarter inch to a half inch and they were ice all the way to the middle. You could mush them up and they were just like crushed ice.'' In northern and central <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, damage was reported to blueberries, strawberries and peaches. Elsewhere, a cold front extending from the upper Great Lakes across the <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> produced widely scattered showers, mainly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. A few showers also dampened parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Namibian guerrilla leader today rejected <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s plan to interrogate insurgents who report to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers to be escorted back to bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. By midday today, territorial police said no guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> had shown up at any of nine checkpoints established Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force monitoring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence. `` It is not the business of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to interrogate or check <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> cadres. It the business of UNTAG and UNTAG alone,'' guerrilla official <PERSON> Kapuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Nauyala </PERSON> said today of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s exiled president, has called on his fighters to withdraw as part of an agreement to get the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan back on track after heavy fighting last week. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> starting April 1, the day a cease-fire was to take hold. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators agree the guerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay in Angolan bases at least until May 15. Territorial officials said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had agreed that police supervised by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers could interrogate guerrillas who report to the checkpoints about the whereabouts of other insurgents and possible arms caches. But a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, no such agreement was reached. <PERSON> Nauyala </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief representative in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, said any questioning by security forces would be unacceptable. `` UNTAG will commit a monumental sin if it allows itself to be co-opted into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s campaign aimed at discrediting and humiliating <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and its military cadres,'' <PERSON> Nauyala </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Black African nations last week denounced the special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, who outraged them by allowing South Africa-led security forces out of bases to fight the guerrilla incursion. White security force officers and Namibian civilians who support <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> predict few guerrillas will report to the checkpoints. They cite the deployment of security force personnel at the points, the proximity of military bases, and poor communication between guerrilla commanders and their forces. Police said some guerrillas might try to cross into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> without reporting to checkpoints and others might hide their weapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Police Chief Inspector <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brune </PERSON> said groups of insurgents were seen today moving south, away from the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> border. No major skirmishes have been reported since last weekend. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says 263 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed in fighting that erupted April 1. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> says 38 of its fighters and 54 civilians were killed. Another 15 guerrillas were captured. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled the mineral-rich territory north of its border since World War I and in defiance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> demands it withdraw. In December, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> agreed to give <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence in exchange for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdrawing its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they supported the Marxist government's forces in a civil war against rebels backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting South African rule since 1966.

<TEXT>
 Christian and Moslem forces fired artillery shells at each others' strongholds in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and nearby mountains today, and police said the barrage killed four people and wounded 17. Motorists sped away after a shell slammed into a seaside boulevard near fish restaurants in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Raouche </LOCATION> district. French Ambassador <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> told reporters a shell hit the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound in the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazmiyeh </PERSON> suburb, causing damage but no injuries. Christian and Moslem forces accused each other of ordering gunners to target residential districts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Counting today's casualties, 184 people have died and 636 have been wounded since the latest round of fighting in the civil war began March 8 between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mostly Christian army and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces. Also today, a Lebanese Christian security guard at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was found dead from a shot to the head, police reported. They said they are investigating the death of <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, 24, whose body was found in a building entrance about a mile from embassy compound in northern <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION> suburb. Lebanese guards support the embassy's Marine contingent. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a group of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> politicians met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, head of a six-member Arab League panel. The politicians, led by <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, discussed ways of ending <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war The panel, formed in January, already has met with Lebanese Moslem and religious leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Syrian gunners provoked today's artillery barrage by shelling several areas in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation blamed the escalation on Christian gunners and said they were targeting the <LOCATION> Raouche </LOCATION> district. Civilians rushed back in to bunkers and underground bomb shelters. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters, and employees ran out of their offices as the thud of exploding shells rocked the city. Last week, Syrian rockets set fire to a depot containing nearly two-thirds of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fuel reserves. The resulting fuel shortage has reduced power supplies in some areas to one hour a day. The worst fighting in four years started after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government, ordered a blockade of ports run by Moslem militias. He said the illegally operated ports were costing the state treasury $ 100 million in lost import dues. In retaliation, <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia shelled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port and the Christian enclave. Later, Syrian gunners joined in the shelling and supported a land blockade of the Christian heartland by Moslem troops of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>. The rival Christian and Moslem governments emerged Sept. 22, when outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like him, to head an interim military Cabinet pending parliament's election of a new head of state. Pro-Syrian Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment, which violated a 45-year-old tradition that gave the premiership to the Sunni Moslems, the house speakership to the Shiite Moslems and the presidency to the Maronites. The division threatens <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with permanent, sectarian partition.

<HEAD>Democratic Party Chairman Rejects Prospect of Fresh Revision of Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> emphatically rejected today the prospect of a fresh revision of the party's rules governing its presidential nominating process. `` I have absolutely no intention to appoint, empower or create any kind of rules commission,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The party chairman made the statement during a news conference at which he announced appointment of party senior staff. Several party activists, including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s campaign manager in his 1984 presidential try, have proposed taking a new look at party rules. While rejecting such suggestions, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he would support one change: to restore the status of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members as so-called super delegates at the next convention. Super Delegates are party and elected officials who go to the convention uncommitted to any presidential candidate and have the potential for breaking any deadlock. At the 1988 convention, the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> members lost their automatic super delegate status to meet a demand from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Named senior adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a Texan who ran Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s last two re-election campaigns. The new political director of the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> will be <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, who has close ties to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and who also worked on the presidential campaigns of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Named director of finance was <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, who has been principal fund raiser for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of elected officials who banded together in 1985 to counter what they believed was the leftward drift of the national party. Continuing as communications director will be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>. In rejecting the idea of another revision of the party's rules, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` We do n't win or lose election because of rules. ... I frankly think if would be foolhardy for this party to spend the next two years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules.'' After presidential election defeats in 1968, 1972 and 1980, the Democrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules. Adfter the 1984 defeat, the party went through a more modest change.

 Hope turned to horror in a small <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town where residents had been raising money to help a family find their missing 21-year-old son. News of the discovery of the body of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, with at least 11 others slain in apparent satanic rituals on a ranch in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, quickly spread through the town about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> disappeared a month ago. `` It's like a nightmare,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> delaHoussaye </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>. `` I really ca n't believe it. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and I said it over and over that we just want to wake up and not believe that it's true.'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a clerk at a convenience store, said: `` Even though it had been almost a month, everyone was really hoping he'd still be alive Everybody's heart is going out to that family.'' <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gautier </PERSON>, who was dining Tuesday at the Busy Bee Cafe, said: `` Most people felt that when they found him, he'd be dead. But I did n't want to discourage anyone from thinking otherwise. I thought he'd be dead, probably shot, but the manner in which he was killed is unreal.'' <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> residents have been donating their time and money to help Mrs. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, search for their son. Last weekend, proceeds from a citywide garage sale and carwash went toward a fund set up for the <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION>. A yellow ribbon ceremony had been scheduled for today to draw attention to <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s disappearance. The ceremony was being turned into a memorial service. `` This little town is real supportive. We're like a big family,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, state prison guard, said of the community of 5,400. `` They may not know you, but they support you.'' `` It's nice to see <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fe </PERSON> help each other, to get money for his parents to go down there and try to find him. It's nice,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPoint </PERSON>, a cashier at the Busy Bee Cafe. Since <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s disappearance during a spring break excursion, the family had distributed about 20,000 fliers in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> as well as appealing to state lawmakers to help with the search. Law officers on both sides of the border had been stumped by the disappearance, with no clues despite an intensive search, the questioning of nearly 100 people and a $ 15,000 reward. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s disappearance also was re-enacted for a segment on the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> television network's `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' program. The mother of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, one of the students with <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> the night he vanished, took the <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION> from their <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> home to the airport Tuesday for the trip to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, near the Mexican town where the bodies were found. `` <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> -RRB- of course is very upset after finding out the news that it really was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> down there,'' <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> said. `` They went down there in hopes that it would n't be, but it did n't turn out that way.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. April 5 <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill: Beaches near the polluted port town of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, smell like gas stations, residents there report. Oil along the shoreline is so thick in some areas that cleanup workers often slip and fall. They wear hard hats to protect themselves. The more that Americans find out about the largest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, the more outrageous the tragedy becomes. The spill will not _ and should not _ fade quickly into the nation's memory. Regulatory changes are in order. National and state governments must make the cost of damaging the environment high enough to force the oil and shipping industries to act more responsibly. Promises are not enough.

 April 5 The News Tribune, <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on banning <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> oil drilling: <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, has authored a bill which calls for a 10-year moratorium on exploratory drilling in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez -LRB- oil spill off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> -RRB-, our support of his bill is stronger than ever. The mind boggles over the possible effect of a major spill off the heavily populated <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The oil industry can counter with a strong argument. If we kiss the domestic exploration goodbye, then it's only a matter of time before the domestic supply dries up and reliance on foreign suppliers grows. We are going to have to continue drilling as long as we rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy, and remain a nation of energy gluttons. What the Exxon Valdez disaster must do is increase our determination to seek alternative sources, such as solar, grain alcohols and nuclear. And we must pursue that dream of all dreams _ fusion.

It has also agreed that rank-and-file union members would, for the first time, be allowed to vote in elections of top-ranking union leaders. Members will nominate and elect union officials who heretofore have been hand-picked by the executive council, and a court-appointed administrator armed with special authority should give a modicum of credibility to a new Teamster era. The deal, however, is not without serious shortcomings. The union's old guard, which has become synonomous with organized crime, remains in place. ... It's a new and long journey toward democracy the teamsters have embarked upon, and the out-of-court settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is only the first tentative step.

It is positively radical compared with his predecessor's inclinations for federal education programs -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- wants to spend $ 423 million on such things as grants for successful schools, scholarships for students who excel in math and science, and funding of magnet schools to expand parental choice. Other efforts would put more non-teachers in classrooms, set up anti-drug programs, reward excellent teachers and help <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges build up endowments. Nothing is settled at this point. The funding will no doubt undergo changes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deliberates these and other measures, but, given the constraints imposed by deficits, there is every reason to be optimistic about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans for education.

 April 5 The <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Gazette on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill: <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill shows dramatically that giant corporations with high-priced executives and state-of-the-art equipment can perform at the moron level The captain of the Exxon Valdez boarded his craft drunk and allowed an unqualified, unlicensed third mate to pilot the vessel. The mate bungled the simple task of steering a straight path through a placid channel 10 miles wide, hitting first one rock, then proceeding to hit another. The hull ruptured, releasing 11 million gallons of oil. That would not have been a problem on many carriers. They have a second hull to catch or limit a spill. But the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> did n't have such a protective inner shell. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> leaders at first denied any major responsiblity. ... Exxon leaders finally apologized 10 days later. By that time, the spill had spread to an area larger than <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and had fouled more than 800 miles of beaches. There is plenty of blame to go around.

How else to explain the zany plan that calls for dressing up <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> as cacti so that they could sneak up on drug smugglers under the cover of darkness, and a mantle of thorns, to gather intelligence for federal authorities waiting to swoop down ... on the evil-doers. The proposal, according to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Komandosky </PERSON>, envisions cactus-attired troops working areas of suspected drug smuggling along the U.S.-Mexico border. ... It is a cockamamie idea. ... In the first place, the Guard should not be enlisted in the war on drugs. Guardsmen are not trained as policemen. Secondly, it casts Guardsmen in the role of stand-up comedians or cartoon characters. ... Finally, it would not work. Does the brain trust responsible for this silly idea really think that drug runners are so easily fooled? ... Alerted to the Guard's trickery by the advance publicity, smugglers scarcely would wait for the cactus-clad Guardsmen to make the first move. Instead, the drug runners would plug every cactus in sight full of lead.

 April 7 The Westerly -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun on financing congressional election campaigns: There's nothing new about indignant cries that the method of financing congressional election campaigns has ... to be improved. The latest compilation of data by Common Cause provides fresh reason to demand reform even more urgently. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who recently retired after serving for a long time as a senator from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> ... acted as a kind of self-appointed watchdog over public spending and long opposed reliance on the political action committee for major campaign funding. In the last election, candidates for a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> accepted a record $ 99.6 million from PACs. ... The bulk of it went to incumbents seeking re-election. There were 408 of them, and they got $ 82.2 million from the PACs. The 328 challengers in contrast received only $ 9 million. When a PAC contributes heavily to a candidate's war chest, there is at very least an unspoken quid pro quo. We must change the system to minimize that influence-buying factor.

 April 11 <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on the pro-choice abortion rally: At least 300,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sunday to leave a message for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. ... Whether the court reads such messages is a matter of debate among legal scholars, but the crowd of men, mothers and daughters, celebrities and ordinary believers in the cause could not have made a more coherent statement, one with which we absolutely agree: Government has no right to pry into a decision as deeply personal, private and agonizing as the one that every year leads 1.6 million women to have abortions. The march, the largest ever seen in the capital, was timed to catch the court's attention as it near the April 26 date for argument in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion case. The court is being asked by anti-abortion forces to use the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case as a vehicle to reverse the 1973 decision in the case of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> that made abortion legal under federal law. ... The march also was intended as a reminder that abortion is a powerful symbol of the rights of women, even the many who oppose abortion, because it involves decisions they are determined to make for themselves about their health and the life they will lead. ... The court must look beyond legal principles to tenable social policy and good sense, and both dictate that the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy meets both of those tests.

Whether the elected People's Deputies get to exercise any degree of power remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the stunning number of high and mighty who were defeated dealt what The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> headlined was `` a mortifying blow to party officials.'' The magnitude of the revolt was made extraordinary by the substantial number of candidates who were defeated even though they ran without opposition. Voters were able to cross out the name of unopposed candidates and thus register a `` no'' vote. If Americans could vote `` none of the above'' or against an unopposed candidate, we suspect many more would go to the polls. The question is: Would our politicians dare to give the people the option of voting for none of the above?

 April 4 <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION> -LRB- Ore. -RRB- Gazette-Times on drift-net fishing: There's good reason for calling drift-net fishing `` strip mining of the sea.'' An Asian fleet of 1,000 to 1,500 vessels deploys as many as 30,000 miles of drift net each day. Floating 30 feet down from the ocean surface, the fine-meshed nylon nets catch not only fish and squid, but everything else they encounter _ dolphins, whales, birds and sea lions. Perhaps even worse, the nets are inefficient, wasting about half the catch that is killed but then lost overboard. ...

 The smoke blanketing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lifted early today as breezes moved in from the northeast. Rain helped firefighters battle the brush fires that have burned 27,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. The clearing allowed the return of nearly 750 illegal immigrants who had been evacuated Tuesday from a detention center less than a mile from one of the two major fires. Firefighters contained one blaze that burned about 11,000 acres west of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seb </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state Division of Forestry, said a cold front was bringing northeast winds to clear the air. `` Smoke problems should be eased through the day,'' he said. On Tuesday, smoke cloaked the area from the edge of the bone-dry <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> to downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Visibility was less than a quarter mile on many roads. Coughing residents fled indoors. Health officials warned residents to stay indoors and turn on their air conditioners. `` I came here for sun and I got smoke _ figure that out,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a tourist from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, as he squinted into the haze Tuesday. Brush fires are common in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the spring, but an unusually dry winter has spawned more of them this year. Evening sea breezes temporarily thinned the smoke cover, and scattered thundershowers appeared Tuesday evening in western <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, where the fires caused the worst damage. Firefighters made progress overnight against a 15,000-acre blaze straddling the <LOCATION> Tamiami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southernmost east-west cross-state road, <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> had ordered 745 illegal aliens moved to a baseball stadium in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and was planning to send them to a Port Isabel, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, immigration camp if the smoke had n't cleared today. Some senior citizens who woke up coughing were alarmed, hospital officials said. `` Fear becomes an integral part of the problem for us. They panic and call rescue,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>.

 A Concorde jet with 100 Americans aboard lost a nine-foot piece of its tail today while attempting the aircraft's first supersonic circumnavigation of the globe, but it landed safely in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. `` It was n't till we got out of the plane and saw the firetrucks and all the press ... that we knew something was wrong,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who helped organize the trip, which cost each passenger $ 39,000. Part of the rudder disintegrated while the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> supersonic jet was flying at 40,000 feet at about 1,500 mph _ nearly twice the speed of sound _ from <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, an airline spokesman. `` It experienced a shudder while over the Tasman Sea that was thought to have been air turbulence,'' said <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>. He said the pilot was unaware of any problem until he was alerted by the control tower at <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s Kingsford-Smith International Airport. But another passenger on the 1,000-mile flight, which lasted one hour and 25 minutes, said the plane shuddered and the passengers were tense. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said, `` There is a possibility they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will find a defect ... that will result in the grounding of other Concordes. But obviously they're hoping that wo n't be so, that this is simply an eccentric fluke.'' `` It was a normal landing, there was no emergency,'' <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> said. `` The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leney </PERSON>, was told by the control tower that a piece of the tail was missing.'' There were no injuries among the 100 passengers, all Americans, on the 38,343-mile journey that started April 1 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boody </PERSON>, a British Airways airport service manager, said the cause of the tail problem was being investigated and that the plane would not be allowed to fly `` unless it is absolutely safe.'' Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said the Concorde was about 15 years old and apparently had never experienced any problems. `` I'm glad that it was a plane that could manage without that much superfluous tail,'' said <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. `` If we had nosedived ... into the <LOCATION> Tasmanian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, there would have been a considerable reaction. But one simply assumes that nothing fatal has happened if indeed there is no confirmation nor any visible invalidation of the ship's performance,'' he said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the airline was sending out spare parts to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to repair the plane, which would go on to <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Friday as scheduled and then to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Another spokesman said the tail sections of other Concordes were being checked. The Concorde had been trying to break the speed record on all stops, making about 12 in all. The planned three-week journey includes stops in exotic locations like <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mombassa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. During the trip, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> planned to broadcast his television show `` Firing Line'' from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. Passenger <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilva </PERSON>, a freelance journalist, telephoned The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with the following account: `` About 25 minutes after takeoff from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> there was a large thump. It was like a vibration. Nothing was said about the thump but everybody looked at everybody else and lunch was served. The stewardesses looked terrified. `` The pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about and that there was a piece loose on the airplane,'' she said. `` We descended very quickly. There was no conversation and then the shuddering stopped.'' Concordes, built by a French-British consortium, have been involved in several minor incidents, but there have been no major accidents. In February, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> gave its fleet of Concorde jets a clean bill of health after safety checks following the discovery of small cracks in the roof structure of one plane. The airline made what it called precautionary checks on five Concordes that had made more than 3,500 landings.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said Wednesday that labor unrest has cost <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> $ 600 million in exports this year and threatens to destroy the nation's economic achievements. `` Our economy now stands at the crossroads,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a meeting of top economic officials and business leaders. In addition to the lost exports, labor problems have resulted in a drop in the country's production of $ 2.4 billion, he said. There have been 395 labor disputes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> this year, up 27 percent from a year ago, and 282 cases have been settled, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, South Korean workers' rights were curbed by authoritarian rule, but a pro-democracy movement in the past two years has encouraged workers to demand more. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said exports have been sluggish after years of high growth and that investment has been shrinking because of labor disputes, coupled with the rising value of the Korean won. A strong won makes Korean exports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> more expensive. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to open wider its market to American products and services. Last month, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suffered its first trade deficit in 19 months. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> urged labor and management to refrain from confrontation in seeking to settle their disputes. The Federation of Korean Industries and five other national economic organizations, in a joint statement, said labor disputes should be settled through dialogue and reconciliation. On March 30, about 14,000 police stormed the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> shipyard in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> to break a 109-day strike by thousands of workers, allegedly supported by outsiders, who had staged a sit-in. No settlement has been reached yet with management. The shipyard reportedly suffered losses of $ 560 million from canceled orders and $ 646 million in delayed exports.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> arrived Wednesday on the first visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by a Chinese head of state in seven years, and Japanese officials said he played down his country's growing ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also expressed support for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s position in a long territorial dispute with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and welcomed increased Japanese investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a Foreign Ministry official said. The ministry official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, quoted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Li </PERSON> that close ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were an important pillar of Japanese foreign policy. `` We hope the improved relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wo n't have an adverse effect on good China-Japanese relations,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We hope the improvements will be carried out in such a way that they will promote peace in all of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years. The Communist countries split in 1960 over bitter ideological and strategic differences. The official quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had `` made some progress, but no major progress'' toward closer relations in the areas of economics, technology and science. `` But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will continue to follow a foreign policy of independence and self-reliance,'' the official quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s demand that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> return a group of islands off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that it seized at the end of World War II, the official added. The dispute over the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> islands has been a major obstacle to the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations. The official said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> expressed pleasure over increased Japanese-Chinese trade, which totaled a record $ 19.3 billion last year, according to Japanese figures. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> provides 80 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s credit and serves as its second-largest trading partner after <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, it accounts for only 8 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s total foreign investment. Japanese reluctance to invest in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> industries apparently has grown in recent months due to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> austerity program aimed at reducing inflation. Some factories have been cut off from credit and raw materials. Shortly before <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s arrival, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament approved an investment protection agreement signed during a visit by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last summer and already ratified by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The pact guarantees Japanese investors in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will receive equal treatment with Chinese businesses. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s visit is the first to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by a Chinese premier since <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, now <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head, visited in May 1982.

 Two French shipments of humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are for both Moslems and Christians and do not mean <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is choosing sides in that country's civil war, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is the friend of Lebanese of all religions, all communities,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. `` The humanitarian aid is a sign of friendship and solidarity for the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people, nothing more than that.'' Both ships arrived in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, on Wednesday morning, the French <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The French minister for humanitarian affairs, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> trying to arrange a means of distribution, a spokesman said. The supplies are to help ease shortages caused by a month of sectarian fighting. One vessel contains fuel and food and the other is a hospital ship with beds, surgical facilities and medical supplies. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from the end of World War I until independence in 1943, has voiced concern about the fate of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian community and sent a special envoy to help mediate the crisis. Lebanese Moslems have said the former colonial power is biased in the dispute. They renounced their share of the supplies and warned the ships against docking, stirring fears the issue could trigger heavier fighting in the nation. The latest confrontation broke out after Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian army units blocked illegal militia-run ports that have been stripping the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> state treasury of about $ 100 million annually Syrian troops joined the Druse forces of <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> in retaliating with a blockade of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and surrounding Christian communities. The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, said the embassy was damaged Wednesday in heavy artillery shelling around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> There are currently more than 4,300 French in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and 840 in mainly Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 Police said Wednesday they would arrest a South Korean dissident upon his return from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where he made an unauthorized visit for talks on national unification. Demonstrations protesting the government plan to arrest Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> broke out in the capital. Dissidents and student radicals said they would defy a government warning and greet the dissident, who was to arrive Thursday from his nine-day North Korean trip. Government authorities planned to deploy 15,000 police at <LOCATION> Kimpo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and other areas to block pro-Moon rallies and anti-government protests by radical groups. Officials said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, 71, faces charges of violating the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, which bans unauthorized trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s archrival. A conviction on the charge carries a possible 10-year jail sentence. At several schools in the capital, groups of 100 to 400 students Wednesday hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police to protest the plans to arrest Moon. Police retaliated with tear gas. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries. In <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 15,000 people rallied against <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trip. Organizers said they would hold more anti-Moon rallies in other cities in the coming week. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, a Presbyterian clergyman, was the first dissident leader to visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He publicly called the North's leader, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, `` a respected president whom I have wanted to meet so long.'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trip triggered a major crackdown on the nation's increasingly militant dissident groups, which officials say are bent on overthrowing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s democratic system

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has expanded its ruling Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to strengthen its forces before a scheduled pullout of Vietnamese troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government after invading in 1978.

The Politburo moves were made at an extraordinary session of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, the radio said. A text was obtained in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The radio said Tie Banh, a vice prime minister and the defense minister, was elected to the Politburo. It also said the three alternate members of the Politburo were made full members and three new alternates were picked. The new Politburo comprises 12 full members and three alternates. Earlier in the day, a national conference of party members elected 21 new members to the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including 11 full members, the radio said. Seven alternate members were also made full members. The broadcast said the committee now has 49 full members and 16 alternates.

<TEXT>
 About 100 newspaper editors sat down after breakfast Wednesday _ about the time millions of their readers were turning to the comic pages _ to discuss whether `` Cathy'' should be political and what to do when the kids grow up in `` For Better or Worse.'' Serious issues these, so there was n't a single outburst of laughter when members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> attended a convention workshop on what funnies they print. How serious? Well, the people who draw the comics are referred to as `` artists.'' Among those who review their works for the syndicates that sell them to newspapers are lawyers, who have a field day with `` Doonesbury,'' and editors, who sometimes must negotiate with an artist to tone down a character's off-color language. And newspaper editors who decide that a strip has gone too far and yank it from the paper for a day or two had better brace: some readers are sure to hurl the ugly term `` censor.'' `` Pulling a strip draws so much attention to it and to you as a censor, that you're reluctant to do it,'' reported <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>, managing editor for features and business at the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In any event, she said, readers are more worldly than editors might think; they often do n't care to be protected. `` People will see that <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> ran it and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> did n't and they'll say, ` Let me be the judge -LRB- of what's off base -RRB-,''' Ms. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> said. She plugged for more blacks and other minorities in the comics, reporting that a month-long census of all the characters on her paper's funny pages revealed that fewer than 1 percent were non-white. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who draws `` For Better or Worse,'' the story of a family much like hers, said she worries about how far to go in injecting her opinion into her comic strip. She has strong opinions on abortion, for example, and might want to express them in her strip, but shies away and thinks: `` Can I handle it?'' She's thin-skinned, she said, and hates hate mail On the other hand, she said, `` I do n't want to be a marshmallow.'' Another problem for Ms. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> was whether to let the kids in her strip grow old. She's decided to _ it's more natural _ but frets `` I'm going to grow right out of a job.'' She gets heart-warming mail from loyal readers who write: `` We've been with you since <PERSON> Lizzie </PERSON> was a baby.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON>, the black artist behind `` Curtis,'' a comic strip about a black kid, said the comics should deal with social issues. He is itching to do a story line on crack, the cocaine derivative, he said, but thinks he'd better let <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, who was created last October, get better established first. `` Let these strips be bold,'' <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON> advised the editors. `` The public is more accepting than many editors think.'' Editors' sensitivities are an old story to <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, editorial director of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, who recalled what happened last fall when a character in `` Cathy'' endorsed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president. Thirty papers pulled the strip for the two-week duration of its political wallowing and three canceled it outright, but two of them quickly came back, <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said. He favors giving artists their freedom, after they've earned it. Artists want to deal with AIDS, animal rights, drugs and shoplifting, and they're bound to do it, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> said they should have as much freedom as columnists; after all, she said, their names are on their strips just like a columnist's byline. On one point, what constitutes a good panel, there was full agreement: a comic strip bats 1.000 when it gets clipped out and mailed to mom or posted on the refrigerator.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today appealed for calm in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and an end to nationalist demonstrations that have claimed at least 19 lives in the southern republic, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> offered to resign after local leaders met to discuss the violence, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The appeal from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the resignation offer came as scattered strikes continued in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and funerals were readied for the people who were killed during the suppression of the protests Sunday. In an address to the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> people, which <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said was published in the republic's capital, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said pro-independence demonstrations `` damaged the interests of perestroika, democratization and renewal in the country.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` The interests of the working people have nothing in common with attempts to sever the existing ties of friendship and cooperation among our peoples, dismantle the socialist system in the republic and push it into the slough of ethnic enmity.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` actions by irresponsible persons'' had to the loss of life in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, and he called on all inhabitants of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to show restraint and common sense. `` We may not allow a blow to be dealt to the interests of any Soviet republic, to the brotherhood of the peoples of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, to the cause of renewal,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said party leader <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> `` asked to be relieved of his duties'' at a leadership meeting Tuesday night and that the party will now decide his fate. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> acted after widespread criticism of Georgian leaders, but the spokesman did not specify what prompted the complaints. Officials have said 18 civilians died in the violence Sunday, but <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> today said another girl had died Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 19. Their funerals will be held Thursday, Friday and Saturday, he said. Pravda put the number of police and troops injured in a clash Sunday between Soviet troops and pro-independence demonstrators at 91. Previously, officials had said 75 soldiers and police were hurt. No reason was given for the change. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, an ethnic Georgian, remained in his home republic to help quell the unrest. He met with people on the street and had a `` heated but at the same time substantive dialogue,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said today the mood remained `` extremely tense'' in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> and several other cities in the republic. A church employee in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, who demanded anonymity, said in a telephone interview that the situation in the capital is `` more or less quiet now'' and that authorities had promised to life an overnight curfew. Authorities continued to enforce a ban on public gatherings. The military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said army officers have been dropping leaflets onto the city from helicopters. It indicated the leaflets were part of an official campaign to counter public anger against the military. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said youths were harassing Soviet soldiers, and `` there are attempts under way to organize provocations against soldiers.'' The newspaper said a major had been pelted with stones and a lieutenant colonel had been hit in the head by a bottle thrown from a window. Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the birthplace of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Soviet media said strikers have been trying to prevent other Georgians from working, including bus drivers and factory workers. The central square where the clash took place was covered today in flowers, placed as memorial tributes to the dead, said <PERSON> Zhorab </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomidze </PERSON>, an editor at the Georgian news agency Gruzinform. Cars and trolleys were adorned Tuesday with black flags, and people wore black clothes and ribbons, said <PERSON> Nana </PERSON> <PERSON> Natadze </PERSON>, wife of a nationalist activist. Demonstrations in the southern republic began April 4. Protesters had attacked calls from some members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazians minority to secede because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Others demanded <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference by the central government in their political, economic and cultural affairs.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Says Restore `Super Delegate' Status to Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, saying he wanted to avoid a `` bloody and divisive fight,'' slammed the door Wednesday on any sweeping re-examination of party rules, but said he would support restoring automatic delegate status to party officials. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s backing for giving `` super delegate'' status to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members could raise a new conflict with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> already was getting caught between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and party activists who want to eliminate a rule that provides for allocating national convention delegates to presidential candidates on the basis of the proportion of votes they received in primaries or caucuses. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign, is leading an effort to restore rules that would require candidates to get a certain percentage of the vote to qualify for receiving any delegates. `` We have to get closure on this process as early as possible,'' said <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>. Told of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s comments, <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said, `` The last thing I want to do is get into a fight with <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> over the rules. ... If <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> goes to the wall on this thing it would be very difficult to do.'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said he was not advocating formation of a new rules commission. He said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> would adopt his proposed changes at a meeting next fall. At the 1988 Democratic National Convention, with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> serving as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager, new party rules stripped <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members of the automatic delegate status for future conventions and instituted proportional representation as the basis for selecting delegates. Still, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contended that minimum-vote requirements resulted in denying him a proportion of delegates equal to the popular vote he received. He also viewed the party and elected officials sent to the convention, as uncommitted super delegates, as a force largely opposed to his candidacy. Only a handful of elected officials backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bid for the presidential nomination. `` I have absolutely no intention to appoint, empower or create any kind of rules commission,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, at a news conference at which he announced the appointments of senior <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> staff. `` We do n't win or lose elections because of rules. ... I frankly think it would be foolhardy for this party to spend the next two years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules,'' he said. After presidential election defeats in 1968, 1972 and 1980, the Democrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules. After the 1984 defeat, the party went through a more modest change. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said recent Democratic election victories in contests to fill vacant House seats were of `` tremendous national significance.'' Democrat <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> was an upset victor in the contest to fill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> once held by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan Solid Growth in Capital Spending This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government reported Wednesday that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses plan to boost their plant and equipment spending this year by a solid 6.3 percent, which analysts said could help forestall a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a survey completed in March found companies planning to spend an inflation-adjusted $ 450.39 billion this year for expansion and modernization, which would surpass the record $ 423.77 billion spent in 1988. The pace of growth in 1989 would be slower than the 10.1 percent increase recorded last year, but analysts said the anticipated gain in capital spending still is healthy and indicates that businesses remain optimistic about the economy's performance. Continued strength in capital spending and the resulting increase in productivity could help extend the life of the economic expansion and ease inflationary pressures that have mounted as factories in some industries operate at rates near full capacity, these analysts said. `` We think the economy will slow down, but we expect that because of continued strong capital spending and continued strong exports we should be able to avert an outright recession,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The new estimate for capital spending in 1989 represents an increase from an earlier survey released in December, when businesses said they planned to boost spending by 5.9 percent this year. The upward revision, based on a survey conducted from January through March, came even as most analysts are predicting the economy will cool this year. Analysts said businesses are likely to scale back their spending plans as evidence of a slowdown builds. `` The year got off to a good start, but what happens from here is going to depend on what happens to their markets,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The question is are they in fact going to carry out their intentions or are they going to be dragged down by developments elsewhere.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up interest rates for a year in an effort to cool the economy and restrain inflation. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and some analysts, however, have expressed concern that the anti-inflation campaign could prove too potent and unintentionally push the country into a recession. Should the survey's spending estimates be realized, `` that would be consistent with what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been desiring, a less vigorous economy but one which is being led by capital spending,'' <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said. The 10.1 percent gain in capital spending last year was the biggest percentage increase since a 16.6 percent rise in 1984, when businesses still were recovering from the 1981-82 recession. Spending had climbed just 2.3 percent in 1987 and dropped 3.9 percent in 1986. The growth in capital spending last year, which came as companies rushed to expand production to meet rising export demand, was credited with helping power strong economic growth in 1988. However, many analysts are worried that last year's export boom has stalled. The smaller anticipated increase in capital spending for this year includes a 4.1 percent planned rise for manufacturing companies to $ 171.44 billion, compared with a 12.9 percent jump in 1988. The projected manufacturing increase includes a 3 percent gain in spending at plants that make durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, and a 5.1 percent increase by companies producing non-durable goods. Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other non-manufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 7.7 percent to $ 278.94 billion. Before adjusting for inflation, capital spending for 1989 is expected to rise by 9.1 percent to $ 468.78 billion after increasing 10.3 percent in 1988.

 President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid $ 62,106 in federal taxes last year on an adjusted gross income of $ 278,171, including his $ 115,000 salary as vice president, according to tax returns released today. Besides <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s salary, the couple also reported $ 155,662 in income from a blind trust they share, $ 7,147 in interest income and $ 12,362 in income from other sources. The Bushes paid taxes equivalent to 21.6 percent of their total income. The adjusted gross income figure for 1988 was nearly $ 30,000 below the $ 308,396 figure from the year before. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who became a millionaire in the oil business in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has a net worth in the range of $ 2 million, much of that wrapped up in the family's $ 3.5 million oceanside home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> claimed $ 65,365 in itemized deductions, which included $ 12,250 in contributions to 39 charities. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, also releasing his tax forms today, reported adjusted gross income of $ 156,546 for 1988. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> paid federal and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> state income taxes of $ 34,309, his office said in a summary of his return. The vice president reported his $ 89,500 salary as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator and $ 51,636 in honoraria from speaking fees. The balance of his income came from interest and dividend income and capital gains, all relating to his family's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also made $ 2,000 as a director of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, a position he would have to give up under the rules recommended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s special commission on ethics All of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speeches for money were made before August, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected him as his running mate, the vice president's office said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> also claimed $ 50,503 in itemized deductions, including $ 17,270 in charitable contributions. The government withheld $ 29,480 from the Bushes' income in 1988, and the president made $ 65,404 in quarterly payments made based on the assumption of what his tax liability would be. When the Bushes' federal tax liability of $ 62,106 was deducted from the $ 94,884 total in money withheld or prepaid, the couple had overpaid by $ 32,778. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president chose to apply $ 15,000 of the $ 32,778 refund to next year's taxes, and to keep the remaining $ 17,778. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reported a net capital gains loss of $ 3,458, and after the standard $ 3,000 deduction allowed by law, had a $ 458 loss which can be carried over to next year. Included in the income that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported on his 1988 tax forms was $ 11,962 in profit from his interest in a liquified natural gas transportation barge in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid only $ 3,328 in state and local income taxes, with the bulk of that going to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in connection with his interest in the barge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a legal resident of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has no state income taxes. He also paid $ 19,034 in real estate taxes, the bulk of that involving his <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> property, and some paid on a vacant lot he owns in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> underwent radioactive treatment today to destroy her thyroid gland because it is producing excess levels of hormones, a condition that has irritated her eyes and caused her to lose 18 pounds in recent months. `` She's just fine, piece of cake, never broke her stride,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, said after the president's wife returned to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> following a two-hour stay at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The radiation was administered in an iodine solution sipped through a straw. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was a colorless liquid that tasted like water, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> reported. Doctors told Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 63, that the only side effect she may suffer is a slight pain in the neck for several days. `` She cracked jokes about that all day,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. Moreover, `` just as a precaution, she should n't hug her puppies for a couple of days and she should n't kiss her grandchildren,'' the spokeswoman said. She explained that puppies and children have a heightened sensitivity to the radiation in Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s body. The first lady has 11 grandchildren and her dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, recently produced six puppies. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed surprise that her treatment attracted so much news media attention, and was `` wondering why her visit to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> gets so much coverage when <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- a non-profit organization for youngsters -RRB- does n't,'' her press secretary said. A White House statement said the procedure `` has no significant side effects'' and has been a standard treatment for 40 years for people suffering with Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s condition, known as Graves disease. Once her thyroid gland has stopped operating, probably in two to three months, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have to take daily medication to maintain adequate hormone levels, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about his wife at a White House ceremony for the college basketball champions while Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was still at the hospital. He replied `` Fine,'' when asked how she was doing. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> consulted doctors last month because of swelling and irritation in her eyes, causing them to tear, and the sudden weight loss. For several weeks, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been treated with methimazole, a drug that blocks production of excess hormones in the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck. Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said the use of drugs was an interim therapy and that the destruction of the thyroid through radiation was a more permanent treatment. Left untreated, Graves disease can be life-threatening, but it generally responds quickly to therapy. It is caused when antibodies attack the thyroid gland and cause it to secrete too much hormone. The disease is more apt to occur in older women. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s treatment with methimazole was discontinued Sunday in preparation for today's procedure. It will be restarted three days after the treatment and then continue until her level of thyroid hormones falls below normal. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is under the care of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physicians <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>, in consultation with Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON>, a thyroid specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Semiautomatic Rifles Poised for Import if Bush Suspension Lifted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Close to 1 million new semiautomatic assault-style rifles could flood the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration decides to end its suspension of such imports. Gun importers have applications to bring in 965,000 of the weapons pending at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, according to spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON>. The import suspension was imposed March 14 after public and police outcries over the increased use of the weapons such as semiautomatic versions of AK-47s and <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> carbines in drug-related violence, and the January slayings of five schoolchildren in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The suspension covered some 400,000 weapons including about 300,000 for which import permits already had been approved. Last week, the administration expanded the suspension to cover 240,000 separate weapons. `` We noticed the increase in these showing up in crimes, an increase in demand, and we reacted to it,'' <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. `` The main thing is that we might be nipping the semiautomatic assault-type rifle in the bud rather than have millions of them flooding in here.'' Nevertheless, gun importers are continuing to submit applications, he said Tuesday. `` It appears there have been a lot more applications that came in after the ban,'' <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> is required by law to permit imports only of weapons suitable or adaptable to `` sporting purposes,'' and it is studying the use of the semiautomatic rifles to determine how they are being used. The review should take two to three months more months. Despite the uproar over such weapons, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> crime statistics reveal that most murders by firearms are still committed by people wielding handguns. Of the 17,859 murders committed nationwide in 1987, 10,556 were committed with firearms of which 7,807 were handguns, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> says that increasing numbers of powerful and sophisticated handguns such as the 9mm semiautomatic, particularly guns such as the Uzi pistol, are being confiscated during arrests. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said it is extremely unlikely that the current import suspension on rifles will be expanded to any handguns. `` Handguns are used in sport, in target shooting, extensively,'' <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. `` That's negligible as far as assault weapons are concerned.'' Many local and federal police agencies have recently begun to arm themselves with foreign-made 9mm semiautomatic handguns, he said. It would be up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make any changes in the availability of such guns, he said. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has introduced a bill that would place some of the same restrictions on both semiautomatic machine-style pistols and assault-style rifles that are now imposed on automatic weapons, including <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks on purchasers and fingerprinting, but not the $ 200 fee charged to owners of machine guns, according to the senator's spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>. Among the semiautomatic handguns that would be restricted if <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill passes are the Uzi pistol, the <ORGANIZATION> Ingram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> 10 and Mac 11 and the Tec 9 and Tec 22, she said. About 231,000 foreign handguns, including semiautomatic weapons, were imported in 1986, the last year for which <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> had data. There was no breakdown for the number of semiautomatic handguns, he said. The number of hanguns being imported has `` been decreasing over the years,'' while more than 1 million handguns have been produced domestically each year, he said. In 1982, some 332,000 handguns were imported, followed by 411,000 in 1983, 341,000 in 1984 and 229,000 in 1985. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Risch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said police are finding assault-style handguns that `` have clips that hold 30, 40, sometimes 50 rounds of ammunition, but yet are still fairly concealable, as opposed to an assault rifle that is more concealable than a hunting rifle, but still a large size.''

The state has signed off on the project between northwest <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and Soviet territorial water, clearing the way for the federal government to issue <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> a permit to drill 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Icy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. The state's ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s plan was consistent with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> plan came the day before the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground, fouling Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> with more than 10 million gallons of oil in the nation's worst spill. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Grogan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION>, said any proposed development in the <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, north of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, likely would be scrutinized carefully by the state and federal governments. `` Virtually anything right now dealing with oil and gas has to be taken in context of the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> disaster,'' <PERSON> Grogan </PERSON> said. `` There's a tremendous amount of clamor in the Lower 48 and coastal states for the president to call for a reassessment of the Outer Continental Shelf,'' <PERSON> Grogan </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> also is being asked to be involved in these discussions. The state, no doubt, will be doing its own rethinking.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> already has approved <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s exploration plan, which calls for up to 60 wells on 11 federal leases over the next four years. `` Although we have not completed our review, we do n't anticipate any real problem with it,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the federal agency's supervisor of field operations Shell should get its permit within 30 days, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> wants to drill its first well more than 15,000 feet deep in 140 feet of water this summer. It plans to drill from a floating rig being refitted in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, B.C. The state encouraged <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> to work with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> to ensure that its plan contains a `` valid prediction of discharge movement and spreading of an oil spill ...'' The state approval requires <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> to employ safeguards to protect fish and wildlife, particularly walruses that inhabit the area.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified today he thought an order to alter documents was designed to hide knowledge by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of secret <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> assistance to the Contras. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> told him to change the documents amid congressional inquiries into the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff's assistance to the Contras during a ban on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. North's testimony contradicts <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who said it was <PERSON> North </PERSON> who proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985. `` The gist of what he wanted removed from the documents was language that would indicate his knowledge or the president's knowledge about my activities in this time frame,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified on his fifth day on the witness stand <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the changes `` were n't done to protect me ... there were people above me.'' `` I did n't think it was unlawful'' to make changes, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, because the order came from `` Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, a cabinet officer 100 steps from the president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> states. I had been led to believe that everything I was doing was done at the direction of the president.'' `` Altering documents?,'' asked prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' responded North. `` You had been told by the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to destroy documents? Explain how you had come to that conclusion,'' asked <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` Because everything I had done that was described on this list, I had been told was at the direction of the president,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he did n't make the alterations in 1985 when <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> originally asked him to because he was busy. `` I just did n't get it done,'' he said. Also, `` it did n't make sense,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He added that many other <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> documents that he was not being asked to change showed secret Contra assistance. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> made the changes when <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, nearly a year after leaving the government, asked him again to do so as the Iran-Contra affair unraveled in November 1986. Even though <PERSON> North </PERSON> was acquiescing to a request from someone who was no longer in the government, `` You were still a pawn in a chess game being played by giants?'' prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked sarcastically. <PERSON> North </PERSON> made the comment about being a pawn last week in testifying about being told by his superiors to attend a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He is charged with obstructing the committee's work by making false statements denying he was assisting the Contras. `` You do n't need to belittle the comment,'' answered North. The former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide said he had been referring to the political struggle between the executive branch and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Among the alterations in the memos from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>: deleting references to compensating <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> for supplying phony end-user certificates in connection with arms shipments to the Contras; omitting a reference to approaching donors for Contra contributions; taking out a reference to sustaining the delivery of lethal supplies to the rebels. Earlier today, <PERSON> North </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> for sending a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that falsely denied the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff was assisting the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> read aloud a section of a proposed response to then-Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> saying, `` None of us has solicited funds ... or ... coordinated the military ... efforts of the resistance. `` That statement is untrue and I did not put it in there,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said of the draft letter to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, D-Md. He said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, then his boss, `` had written his own'' letter on Sept. 12, 1985. `` What did you do to straighten it out?'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked. `` I am quite certain I did n't do much ... at all,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> replied. He said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> `` had already put this kind of language in his letter'' on Sept. 5, 1985 to Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., then the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I wrote a number of other letters'' that were `` inconsistent with the facts ... I just simply do not believe I wrote this letter,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` Those ... words are written in Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s handwriting.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> interjected: `` And apparently sent to you for editing.'' `` And that is a point I would contest because I do n't believe it was sent to me for editing,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. Among 12 criminal counts, <PERSON> North </PERSON> is accused of making a false statement to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the letters to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. No charges have been filed against him in connection with letters he says he wrote on Contra support to at least one other congressman and two senators.

 Assailants hurled firebombs inside the <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and an electronics firm Wednesday, and police blamed both attacks on supporters of jailed terrorists staging a hunger strike. Two employees were slightly injured in the stock exchange attack when at least six masked youths entered the main hall before opening time and threw firebombs at computer terminals. Security officials seized three attackers, but the others escaped, said <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>. He said those held were two women, ages 24 and 27, and a 28-year-old man. Authorities said the attack destroyed or damaged several computers and delayed the opening time by a few minutes. Earlier in the northern city of <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION>, unidentified assailants set off a firebomb inside the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> AEG </ORGANIZATION> electronics firm, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> automotive and high-technology conglomerate. Authorities said the 3:30 a.m. attack caused millions of dollars worth of damage but no injuries. Those attackers got away. The federal prosecution spokesman in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, said supporters of jailed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> members on a hunger strike claimed responsibility in a letter left near the scene. At least 34 imprisoned terrorists have been fasting to demand a special cell block for jailed members of the radical organization, which seeks to undermine West German capitalism with assassinations, bank robberies and other attacks. Police said they believe group sympathizers carried out the stock exchange attack as well. `` We are going on the supposition that this -LRB- the stock exchange attack -RRB- is in connection with the ongoing hunger strike and demands for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> inmates to be placed together,'' said <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>. Two of the fasting prisoners, <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellwo </PERSON>, claim to have subsisted only on vitamins and water for 71 days. They are reported to be in serious condition. The message left near the electronics firm demanded that the hunger strikers be housed together in one or two large groups, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is worried the attacks could be a prelude to more violence by sympathizers. `` We fear that this is going to continue. We can only hope that people do n't become victims of the attacks,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush Administration To Release Aid To Egypt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has decided to release $ 230 million in economic aid to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> that had been held up while the Arab government undertook bureaucratic reforms, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Formal notification to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected by the end of the week. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can delay the resumption of aid, but legally can not block it. Besides, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, there is no serious opposition to ending the one-month suspension. The $ 230 million covers cash payments to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for this year and for 1988. Overall, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is due to receive $ 1.63 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic assistance for the two years plus surplus food, making it the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid recipient except for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> conditioned delivery of the $ 230 million in cash payments on unspecified reforms in the way <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> administers the aid. A decision to resume was taken coincide with the visit here last week of President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. In response to a reporter's question, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> press office issued a statement quoting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> `` enjoys our full support as he implements courageous reform measures to strengthen <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s economy for future generations.'' The statement added: `` Our cash transfer assistance will be part of that support. We will be consulting with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and working out the details of the release of the money in cooperation with the Egyptian government.'' Aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was boosted after the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. Since then, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been liberal in assisting the two countries as its most reliable friends in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The aid also is a subtle way of encouraging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy in the region. At the moment, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is backing a proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has called instead for an international peace conference and said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> should participate. But <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has not rejected the proposal categorically. The Arab League, of which <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is a member, and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> both rejected the proposal this week. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked all critics to withhold judgment until the proposal is developed. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no direct appeal was made to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened talks last December over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s objections. The official said another meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will be held but not for several days at least. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has one of the most cumbersome bureaucracies in the world as well as a booming birth rate. An estimated 1 million people are added to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s population every 10 -LCB- months. There is widespread poverty and housing is at a premium. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, during his visit, told American businessmen his government was making progress in cutting red tape and in curbing population growth. But he said the effort was partly offset by a decline in the death rate.

<HEAD>Activist Says Wheat Outlook Shaky, and Looking Worse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer advocate said Wednesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat outlook is so shaky that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should suspend further export subsidies until the situation improves. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive director of the private, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said he wrote <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> on April 3 to repeat a similar request made last fall, `` when the situation was less precarious'' and steps `` could have been taken to safeguard supplies.'' The target of <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s complaint is the Export Enhancement Program, which subsidizes the sale of wheat and other commodities to selected foreign countries. Huge sales of wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been made under the program since the arrangement was authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said this week the program had helped significantly in getting agricultural trade discussions moving under the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also said in an interview with a group of reporters on Monday that the subsidy program would be reviewed to see how effective it has been and whether `` too much or too little'' is being spent on it. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said that the condition of the winter wheat crop is deteriorating and that experts in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and in the major production areas point to a harvest this year of about 1.6 billion bushels. A spring wheat output of 600 million bushels would make a total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat harvest of about 2.2 billion bushels. If wheat use in the 1989-90 marketing year, which will begin June 1, totals in the range of 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion bushels, this year's harvest would fall short of meeting demand. In that case, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said in his letter to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, at least 200 million bushels of wheat will have to be drawn from existing stocks, which are estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to be drawn down to 549 million bushels by June 1. Thus, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile by June 1, 1990, could well be down to around 300 million bushels. According to department records, that would be the the smallest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat reserve at the end of a marketing year since 1952, when it was 256 million bushels. `` This is hardly adequate as a domestic reserve, and will leave the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unable to intervene if famine conditions develop anywhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ... a month ago said that world grain stocks will be drawn down again in 1989-90 for the third year in a row.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> added: `` In effect, <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> does not expect food grain production to increase significantly in any of the major food-producing areas outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' The department's first official estimate of 1989 winter wheat production, which usually accounts for three-fourths of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total, will be released May 11. Meanwhile, department analysts have used unofficial projections showing that the 1989 wheat harvest could be as low as 2.3 billion bushels, or slightly more than <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s benchmark. The biggest problem is in major areas of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, particularly in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the No. 1 wheat producer, where soils have been parched since the crop was planted last fall. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is scheduled to tour some of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat area on Friday, his office said. There has been congressional pressure on the department to extend 1988 drought relief to the stricken winter wheat farmers.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawyer Asks for Review of New Decree on Subversion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading lawyer called Wednesday for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review a new law on subversion, saying it may conflict with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost. The decree appears to be aimed in part at stopping nationalist unrest like that in the republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. It bans premeditated acts aimed at inciting nationalist or racial animosity and actions aimed at undermining the Soviet political and economic systems. Many dissidents have said the decree restricts freedom of speech and other human rights, but the criticism by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> was the first made publicly by a Soviet lawyer. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a department head at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Law, made the remarks at a news conference and in an article published Wednesday in the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. He said that in general, the decree was an improvement over earlier regulations banning `` anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'' and `` anti-Soviet slander.'' Those rules have been used to jail dissidents. However, the lawyer said a section in the new rules on `` discrediting'' government bodies should be clarified. The clause says `` publicly insulting or discrediting'' government or state bodies or officials can be punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to $ 3,200. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said his institute, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, had drafted the decree. However, he said it was surprised by the clause. `` The regulation on insulting and discrediting was just as much news for us as for you,'' he told reporters. The lawyer said he did not know who inserted it into the decree, which was approved Saturday by the Presidium, or executive council, of the Supreme Soviet. The decree took effect Monday and will be reviewed later by the full legislature, which can make changes, <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> suggested the discrediting rule might conflict with glasnost, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, because people should have the right to criticize their government. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> called for `` urgent authoritative clarification'' of the clause by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court can overturn the decree and send it back for revision if it is deemed unconstitutional. `` If an organ is discredited by true information that is revealed and objectively a loss of faith occurs as a result of unconstitutional, illegal or criminal actions, in that sense there can be no moral or criminal reproach,'' <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. Another lawyer at the news conference, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshetnikov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Legislation, said the decree should have banned only false accusations.

 The dropout rate for public school students has leveled off over the past few years, according to statistics released Wednesday. Figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> for the 1987-88 school year show the four-year dropout rate for high school students was 26.8 percent and the systemwide percentage was 29.7.

A separate study that followed individuals for their four years of high school ending in 1988 said 20.8 percent of the students had dropped out. In 1987, this study said 22.4 percent of students quit. Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said more funding is needed for dropout prevention programs. The studies use separate methodologies to determine the dropout rate. The Cohort Report follows students for four years after they enter ninth grade and the Annual Dropout Report analyzes the students who dropped out during 1987-88. The Annual Dropout Report also offers a racial and ethnic breakdown and showed that the dropout rate among Hispanic students was significantly higher than the average. It said the four-year, systemwide dropout rate among Hispanic students was 31.8 percent; for blacks, 24.5 percent; whites, 19.2 percent; and Asians, 15.2 percent.

<HEAD>Council Finds No Compelling Need for Commercially Developed Platform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no compelling need for a commercially developed space platform proposed for use before a larger planned space station is put into orbit, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has concluded. A report by the council, released Tuesday, was based on a study by a panel of scientists and engineers. Its recommendations were counter to the proposal by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for heavy federal support for the commercial space platform. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had opposed the proposed venture as a possible competitor with its own space station to be put in orbit by 1996. The report said there was no compelling need for a separate, commercially developed facility for the conduct of research at low or zero gravity before then. It said use of the space shuttle flights `` will accommodate the vast majority of anticipated experiments'' planned by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in the interim. It said after the space station is built, however, construction of another facility for long-term microgravity experiments `` may well have merit'' if there are advances in microgravity research and space automation. The report said the committee `` found no evidence to suggest that microgravity research would lead to significant space-based manufacturing in the next five to 10 years.'' `` The committee considers that microgravity science is at an immature stage due to lack of understanding of the fundamental processes involved in this area of space research,'' the report said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's 1988 space policy recommended support for an orbiting spacecraft for microgravity research which would be owned and operated by private business rather than <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. The federal government would be its main user, however, and would lease as much as 70 percent of the facility at a cost estimated at more than $ 700 million over five years. The proposal for the private platform was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, run by former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers and astronauts. It said its space platform could be launched as early as 1992. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> requested the council study the scientific and commercial benefits of the proposal. The council is an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>.

 A document introduced at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial strengthens the suggestion that then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was being rewarded for its support of the Nicaraguan rebels with additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> draft memo bears the handwritten notation, `` We want VP to also discuss this matter'' with Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. The handwriting in the margin of the Feb. 20, 1985 document is next to a typewritten section of the memo detailing the quid pro quo arrangement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had earlier warned against the possibility of such arrangements, according to another document released earlier in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial _ the minutes of a June 25, 1985 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said there could be a problem if the administration used <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to entice third countries to aid the Contras. The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees looked into the possibility the administration had engaged in such arrangements but were unable to prove they existed. Asked about the new documents coming to light at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that all the documents had been made available to the independent counsel prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON> for his review in the past. It is up to the counsel to decide whether to turn them over to the investigating committees, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the White House was not investigating any of the matters. A 42-page summary of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's quid pro quo arrangements with other countries on Contra support was released last week. It said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> and told him about enhanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid shortly after the quid pro quo arrangement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was made. But the summary did not say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew the enhanced aid was in exchange for the Central American country's support of the Contras.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday approved a bill to reorganize the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and require studies, reports and decisions affecting a variety of products ranging from cigarette lighters to reclining chairs. The bill was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by the on commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness subcommittee on a voice vote after rejecting an amendment that would have renewed the commission's basic laws without change. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to agree on such a renewal since 1983, and the commission has operated under automatic year-to-year renewals granted by appropriations bills. Last year, the parent committee approved a bill almost identical to the one passed by the subcommittee Wednesday, but it was too late in the session for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to act. Among major changes that would be made by the bill is the designation of two members as a quorum when there are only three members. Although the commission is authorized to have five members, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent years has appropriated money for only three salaries, and a current vacancy means the commission can not act at all because the quorum requirement is now three. The bill would require among other things: _ A study of flammability standards for pajamas and nightgowns used by the elderly _ A study of age requirements for operating amusement park rides _ A survey of reclining chairs for compliance with existing standards _ A report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on what the commission is doing about indoor air pollution _ The adoption of a standard for lighters to protect children The bill would also give state attorneys general the same power as the commission has to bring suits in federal courts and would permit consumers to petition for safety rules, with a 120-day deadline for action on such petitions. The bill is backed by major consumer organizations but opposed by major business groups. The author of the defeated amendment for a straightforward renewal, Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't think there is any evidence the commission is not doing its job and I am particularly alarmed at the budget increase'' the bill would authorize. The bill would set a ceiling on appropriations of $ 39 million next year and $ 40 million the year after. <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>'s amendment would have set ceilings of $ 34 million and $ 35 million; the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has recommended an appropriation of $ 33.5 million, down from $ 34.5 million this year. Deaths caused by products under the commission's jurisdiction have fallen from about 26,000 in 1975 to 22,000 in 1984, `` and the per capita decline has been more dramatic'' because the population has grown, <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's fair to the commission to put so many things in it -LRB- the bill -RRB- they ca n't handle,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling for `` definitive ethical standards'' in government, today proposed tightening conflict-of-interest rules through such restrictions as bans on honoraria for judges and on personal use of congressional campaign funds. In a wide-ranging package covering activities by executive branch employees as well as judges and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed changes in the campaign finance laws. He said current law that allows lawmakers to convert campaign funds to personal use should be abandoned because leftover political donations `` should not become a kind of individual retirement account for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The law now allows anyone who held office before 1980 to use leftover campaign contributions for any lawful purpose, including personal use. The president also called for elimination of campaign contributions by special-interest political action committees. `` We've allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowed by special interests ... and I believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by PACs,'' he said. His announcement today was an attempt to fulfill his pledge to bring higher ethical standards to government. `` You're never going to legislate away impropriety,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> Editors convention where he announced the proposals. `` But these values in ethics can be encouraged, respected.'' In a question session with the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still considers <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, a national hero because `` anybody that gets a Purple Heart, sheds his blood fighting for his couuntry, deserves to be called an American hero.'' But he said, `` the last thing I want to do is intervene'' in the ongoing case in which <PERSON> North </PERSON> is standing trial on charges he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and destroyed government documents in the Iran-Contra case. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said in answer to a question that the reason he is friendly and social with reporters is not to `` seduce'' them into favorable coverage. `` We're treating them as human beings ... I want to treat the press with the dignity to which it is entitled.'' In a message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accompanying his ethics package, the president said, `` The proposals represent an effort to communicate definitive ethical standards to federal employees throughout our government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s package included an executive order to cover executive branch employees and a legislative proposal to give judges a 25 percent pay raise, coupled with the honoraria ban for judges. An honoraria ban already applies to executive branch officials, and in his speech the president said he wants to extend it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. However, he did not include such a package in the largislative package, saying he wanted to take it up at a future time in connection with a congressional pay raise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision not to propose a congressional honoraria ban prompted criticism that he is letting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> off easy, by not seeking to bar the speaking fees that enrich lawmakers' $ 89,500 annual salaries. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of the civic action group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` caved in to pressure by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who want to keep this corrupt system going. He knows better and it appears the president does n't have the courage of his convictions.'' Common Cause supports a pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and opposes all honoraria on the ground they promote excessive influence by the special interest groups that pay members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for speeches. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, in its report March 10, endorsed a ban on honoraria for all three branches of government. The president backed a 51 percent pay raise previously, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself voted against giving its members a raise this year. While turning down the congressional honoraria recommendation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is accepted a commission recommendation to bar members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members and senior personnel in the judicial and congressional branches who leave the government from lobbying their former offices for one year. Executive branch employees already are subject to such a ban. The commission was created by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to recommend changes in government ethics rules. It reviewed matters such as outside income, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure and post-employment lobbying. In the order covering the executive branch, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> barred senior government officials from serving on the boards of profit-making enterprises. He proposed that the ban be extended to congressional and judicial officials as well. The executive order also would give elevated rank to a designated ethics officer in each department, and would do away with `` compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of the executive branch for purpose of lobbying after working for the government. That means that executive branch workers, currently barred for a year from lobbying their former office once they leave the government, would be under the same restriction regarding all the departments of the executive branch. Full-time presidential appointees, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employees and <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> employees also would be barred from receiving any outside income.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has increased to more than 8,100 the number of military-base sites being surveyed for hazardous substances and pollution, according to a report send to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. Actual cleanup work is going much more slowly, however. By the end of the past fiscal year, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had projects under way at more than 1,260 polluted sites. The report, covering the year ending last Sept. 30, cites the jump in sites undergoing preliminary surveys as a development that demonstrates a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> commitment to restoring polluted areas under military control. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> made significant progress during fiscal 1988,'' the report says. It covers the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> agencies and the military services to comply with a section of the Superfund law of 1986 that expanded the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. That program received $ 404 million in fiscal 1988. According to the report, 8,139 sites at 897 military installations had been identified for surveys by the end of the fiscal year to determine if a cleanup was needed. The totals at the end of the previous year had been 5,165 sites at 739 installations. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> attributed the jump to a desire to check `` primarily smaller installations such as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Reserve properties'' after it had completed reviews of large, known problem areas around the country. The report further discloses that more than 4,400 sites have been moved into the next phase of the program, in which a more in-depth investigation is conducted and cleanup alternatives considered. That work has been completed only at about 1,500 of the sites, however. The third and final phase of the program _ actual cleanups _ is still moving at a relatively slow pace, the report indicates. As of the end of the fiscal year, actual cleanup work and `` remedial actions'' had been completed at 216 polluted sites _ a net gain of 90 compared to fiscal 1987. Cleanup work is under way at 1,266 other sites, the report states.

 A barge carrying the mammoth reactor vessel from the nation's first commercial nuclear plant completed an 8,000-mile trip today to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where it will be buried at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear complex. Protesters hurled paint canisters and unfurled banners as the reactor vessel from the dismantled <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, nuclear plant made its way up the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in six-week journey that took it through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The barge arrived at a dock on the edge of <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>. The reactor vessel will be trucked 25 miles to the burial trench where it will be entombed Friday. <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, the government nuclear weapons complex, already is the final resting place for three nuclear submarine reactor cores. The 1,000-ton reactor vessel, 45 feet high and 18 feet across, once held the uranium fuel that powered the nation's first commercial nuclear plant, which shut down in 1982. The vessel was packed with concrete for the journey, and officials said it poses no threat of radiation. As the barge made its way up the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION> on Tuesday, 50 to 70 protesters on a bridge waved banners and signs and hurled canisters of lime green paint. At least three small containers of paint were hurled from the bridge. One struck the gray cover of the reactor vessel and two others hit the barge. `` We're trying to show that the local community in the gorge is not thrilled to be a nuclear highway,'' said <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> deBruler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bingen </LOCATION>, an organizer of the demonstration. Earlier Tuesday, a fire broke out in the engine room of the tugboat pushing the barge, causing a seven-hour delay but no injuries, said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the company that owns the tug. `` At no time was there any danger of the reactor vessel going aground,'' she said. But Ms. <PERSON> DeBruler </PERSON> said the fire showed the potential for danger. `` If there were 60 mph winds, and it was powerless, it could lead to an accident,'' she said. The protesters said their main concern with the vessel is leakage into the river after it is buried.

<TEXT>
 The White House declined to comment Wednesday on a published report that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has agreed to allow 40 percent of the work on a new, co-produced jet fighter to be done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, citing an unidentified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has also eased its reluctance to share technology from the FSX fighter venture. The newspaper said the concessions signaled that the deal would shortly be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where critics have said the project could amount to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> giveaway of much-needed aircraft technology to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s aircraft industry. Asked about the status of the FSX negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, White House spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON> said: `` I do n't have anything new on it. As far as I know, it's still under discussion. Nothing is resolved at this point.'' Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said he found the Times story `` a little bit premature. Things are close, but not quite there yet.'' <PERSON> Shingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamagami </PERSON>, press counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, also declined to comment on the Times story. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials `` are still continuing their discussions about clarifications. We have n't reached any final conclusion yet.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reached an agreement in principle late last year under which St. Louis-based <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce a next-generation fighter, for deployment by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the late 1990s. The project to build the FSX, which would be an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, has been stalled due to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision to obtain `` clarifications'' from the Japanese. Proponents argue that the agreement represents the best the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could negotiate _ in view of Japanese opposition to buying American-made F-16s _ and will promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions while providing income and jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. Critics, however, contend that the deal amounts to a giveaway of $ 7 billion worth of technology that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> likely will use to help propel its aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should, instead, purchase American planes to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> would have an official state soil to nourish its official state tree and state flower under legislation passed Wednesday by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, approved 25-8 and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would honor the <LOCATION> Kalkaska </LOCATION> soil series. The sandy soil, one of about 450 soil types, is located across both peninsulas and covers 500,000 acres of the state's 35 million acres. The soil type is named for <LOCATION> Kalkaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where it first was found by state soil researchers in 1927. The soil is practically exclusive to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with only a small amount found in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` It is a very pretty soil, with distinct layers of dark and light,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Binsfeld </PERSON>, a Republican who represents _ no surprise here _ <LOCATION> Kalkaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` Our state tree, the white pine, is found in <LOCATION> Kalkaska </LOCATION> soil.''

 When a book was returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> 22 years late and worse for wear, librarians had no complaints. Four $ 100 bills fluttered out, more than enough to pay the fine. `` The book's a bit shabby, but it's back home again,'' Librarian <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said Tuesday. The book, titled ` The Folk Song Abecedary'' by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leisy </PERSON>, arrived at the library in a plain brown wrapper last week. Folded inside was a note from the anonymous borrower. `` This book was removed from your library several years ago. I am returning it with overdue fines and apologies,'' the note said. Ms. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said that based on the 5-cent-per-day fine the library levies for overdue books, this one must have been checked out 22 years ago, shortly after it was put on the shelves. Circulation records are not kept that long, so the only clues to the whereabouts of the borrower is the postmark from <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and the book being wrapped in the <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>.

 Hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was wanted for murder in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> two years before his 1985 seizure of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner, according to a police document presented Wednesday at his trial. Lebanese police sent the document in response to a request from West German federal police for information on <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> following his arrest in January 1987. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage for 17 days and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport when customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage. The document read in court said a Lebanese arrest warrant was issued for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> in July 1983 for `` murder and illegal possession of weapons.'' It gave no details. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1984, told the court he knew nothing about it. It was not clear if the warrant is current. `` I have been carrying weapons since 1979 with the permission of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> authorities,'' he said. Since the civil war broke out in 1975, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital's western part is policed by Moslem militias and the eastern sector by Christian forces. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said the arrest warrant may have been issued by Christian authorities. He has testified he fought in battles in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before and after his stay in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He also has testified that he belonged to Amal, a mainstream Shiite Moslem militia, from 1980 to 1982. He has denied prosecution charges he later joined <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a radical <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The court also was read five letters <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> wrote from the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prison after his arrest. Prison authorities apparently intercepted them after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> tried to have them smuggled out. In one letter, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> appeared to solicit the help of his brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s security chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Several times <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> advises <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> to be `` very careful.'' `` They are asking me about you all the time and they have found out that I am with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>,'' one letter says. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> confirmed he wrote the letters but refused to answer any questions about them. In several letters, he discussed worries he would be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> requested his extradition but the West German government refused. The trial resumes April 19, when Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> says he hopes to have the final presentation of evidence.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Thank you all very much. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON>, thank you. Please. Well, I'm delighted to be here and look forward to taking a few questions. I've been getting such a ribbing about my highly stylized prose, I thought it only appropriate for me to share a few recent headlines with you. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- I'm sure nobody here would write things like this, but _ -LRB- scattered laughter -RRB- _ `` Dentist Receives Plaque,'' that was one, but _ -LRB- laughs -RRB- _ no _ -LRB- laughter -RRB-. `` Actor Sent to Jail for Not Finishing Sentence.'' -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- And, `` The Rest of the Year May Not Follow January.'' -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- I'm tempted to gloat. If that's the standard, I'm not doing too bad. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said, `` An editor is a person who separates the wheat from the chaff and prints the chaff.'' -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- So I know I'm probably responsible for providing my fair share of chaff, but after all, I am the guy that said during the campaign, `` a kitchen in every pot'' _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ and also that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s freedom _ I was reminded by some of these back here _ `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s freedom is the example by which the world expires.'' So _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ let no one miss the message, as editors, you uphold a certain ethical standard in your newsrooms, and you've got to do that, because a newspaper is only as good as its word. And I think this is no less true than government. High ethical standards are central to this administration, and we're going to enforce them strictly, comprehensively, fairly, and to the letter and spirit of the law. And we've got to work together to reform a public code of conduct that, at times, appears to be in disarray. And it's not logical or fair code _ it's both too harsh and too lenient, and it elevates detail over substance, precept over principle. And so today, I want to talk to you about some proposals of our administration, because such a system as now constituted, ultimately breeds cynicism and contempt for the law. To truly reform it, we must remember that standards of trust and honesty are not dictated from regulations written in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Ethics in public service derive from the natural integrity of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. They are to be found in the everyday conduct of working men and women _ in the postman who checks out the _ checking up on the elderly resident at home, or _ and the cashier who runs after the customer that's been overcharged. The millions of Americans who meet their obligations honestly, and teach their kids to do it the same way, see nothing extraordinary about asking the same of their government. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are troubled when they hear of officials in every branch of government, at whatever level of government, who show a brazen contempt for the letter or spirit of the law. And the American people do not understand why certain behavior is considered criminal when committed by an executive branch official, or perfectly legal when committed by someone in another branch of government. Is not a crime a crime? Should there not be an underlying standard of integrity for all? And as president-elect, I heard about talented men and women, who, though perfectly honest, declined to _ declined to come to serve in government out of fear; fear of the sheer complexity of federal ethics laws, fear that a simple, honest mistake could lead to a public nightmare. And these concerns led me to issue an executive order creating the President's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform. And I asked its members to recommend steps to foster full confidence in the integrity of all federal public officials and employees.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Say Agreement Near</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional budget negotiators expressed confidence Wednesday that agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was near on a $ 28 billion deficit reduction plan for next year. `` The parameters are there. The outline of an agreement is there,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The negotiating group, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, and the senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees, was checking its own ideas with people who would have to approve them. `` When you do a budget, there are a whole lot of numbers and agreements to put together in which you have to gain the complete cooperation of a lot of people in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> other than the negotiators. So you have to run around and talk to all your friends'' on various committees, said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We have not hit anything that could be called a snag,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader In more than a month of talks, the group has been searching for a compromise that would reduce the fiscal 1990 federal deficit by about $ 28 billion, to comply with the Gramm-Rudman law's goal of limiting red ink to $ 100 billion. About half of the savings would come from holding spending growth below inflation for military and many domestic programs, and the other half from new revenues _ user fees, sales of government assets, and about $ 5 billion in new taxes. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget included about the same amount of new revenues, but mostly from his proposal to cut the tax rate on capital gains. A lower tax rate on capital gains would actually yield additional revenue of $ 4.8 billion next year, according to the administration. Congressional Democrats oppose the capital gains plan as a break for the wealthy, but the negotiators have agreed to include the overall tax figure in their plan in hopes that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president can agree later on something that wo n't violate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no new taxes'' pledge The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group of conservative lawmakers, on Wednesday approved a resolution opposing any new taxes in the pact.

 Cable television executives faced a buzz saw Wednesday from congressional, broadcast and consumer critics who said cable companies are reaping billions of dollars in profits at the public's expense. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, led the attack at a congressional hearing, saying cable rates have risen an average of 32 percent nationally since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> lifted virtually all regulations on cable operators in 1984. `` The government reports that the price consumers pay for cable service increased at a greater rate than any other commodity or service in the entire <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said what little authority the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has to regulate cable is `` a joke.'' He introduced two bills that would allow city governments to regulate cable TV rates, require that cable programmers make their shows available to competing services such as satellite-delivery and `` wireless cable,'' and prohibit any one cable company from serving more than 25 percent of cable subscribers nationwide. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, said the cable companies now dominate the local TV marketplace. `` In 1984, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Cable Act, cable characterized itself as a struggling, infant industry,'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said. `` That act, which in essence removed all regulatory oversight, has become the communications equivalent of anabolic steroids. Today, cable television operators enjoy an unregulated monopoly. Amazingly, only 32 of more than 8,000 cable systems have any direct competition.'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said cable TV now is a $ 14 billion industry that is available to nearly 80 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, testified that competition in the cable marketplace could drive down prices by as much as 50 percent, with a savings to consumers of $ 6 billion. But <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON>, `` strongly denied'' the monopoly label and said cable was providing `` more and better programming'' by owning both the program suppliers and cable systems. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> also said cities reap billions of dollars in franchise fees from cable operators, and municipalities are free to give those franchises to other companies if they do n't like the existing cable serivce. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said pre-1984 cable rates had been held artificially low by municipal regulation. The industry incurred huge construction costs in the 1980s while the number of channels increased greatly. The subcommittee is studying the cable industry and the antitrust implications of the proposed merger of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last week gave the merger its blessing.

 After 20 days of arduous work and uncounted millions of dollars, the worst effects of the nation's biggest oil spill appear to be waning Yet for all the work done by 1,000 people on the water and shoreline and other thousands of support personnel, much of the result is being attributed to the muscular forces of nature. `` The natural processes have far outweighed ours,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, the state's cleanup coordinator, said earlier this week. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and other officials acknowledge much of the easing situation must be credited to nature: _ An estimated 30 to 40 percent of the 10.1 million gallons of oil that poured from the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> has been dissipated by natural evaporation of the more volatile components of the crude oil By Thursday less than 20,000 barrels, under 10 percent of the spill, will have been recovered by human effort. _ Favorable weather through most of the 20 days since the spill pushed vast amounts of the oil out of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where several days of high wind and heavy seas churned and broke up the slick _ Aerial observations this week indicated that some blackened beaches on the islands and inlets of the sound are being cleansed by the heavy wave action The spill's disastrous effects are far from over. It is feared the toll of wildlife will continue and even grow as migrating birds return to the oiled beaches. It will be years before scientists know the impact on the vast ecosystem in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Yet scientists are warning that nature must be given a big share of the cleanup work that remains. They say too much human labor and technology applied to oiled areas could do more harm than good. `` We've seen from other spills that if we hit an area too hard with things like high pressure water or heavy equipment, we wind up killing everything,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chief of the hazardous material response branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said much of the shoreline hit by the oil is of a rock and gravel mix. If efforts to clean the beaches are too vigorous, he said, it could force the oil deep into the ground, where it can affect microscopic life valuable to the area's ecosystem. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the public's anxiety to clean the remaining mess as quickly as possible must be balanced with the realization that some areas would be better left to a slower cleanup job by nature. `` I'm optimistic that the officials here understand that,'' he said. `` I would hope that the public does n't get frustrated with what might seem like a slow process and not press us into doing it too fast.''

What I did, I did for my people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> told a reporter during a tour of the security wing of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monde </LOCATION> prison in central <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Dihu </PERSON>, 20, from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, was sentenced in January 1988 to 25 years jail for getting a gun that another Palestinian used to kill an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier. Asked if she regretted her act, Ms. <PERSON> Dihu </PERSON> responded in a voice choked with emotion: `` Why should I be? We are fighting for our justice. We are at war. All's fair in love and war ... `` I would love to go back to fighting with my people in the intefadeh,'' she said, using the Arabic word for the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. She is one of 24 Palestinian women transferred to a segregated wing here after the rebellion spilled over to the central women's prison at <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> The tensions resulted in hair-pulling battles between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> criminals and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> political detainees. `` They beat up one of the Palestinian women and shouted curses against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and our leaders,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulatta </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who awaits trial on charges of organizing anti-Israeli demonstrations March 8. The political activism of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> women is a change in traditional lifestyle that has grown out of the uprising. As thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> men have been arrested or wounded, women and children have taken their places at the forefront of street protests. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials refuse to say how many women are behind bars. During the tour, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women complained of rodent excrement in food, mosquitoes in cells and lack of medical attention. They live two to a cell in a two-story wing with a central courtyard open to the sky. Children's paintings of an Arab village and a field of flowers remain from the facility's days as a juvenile center. Ms. <PERSON> Boulatta </PERSON>, who has been jailed four times for political activism, complained she receives no medical help for a liver dysfunction diagnosed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors. She said a doctor visits the prisons for a half hour three times a week. `` They only look at me and say ` you're okay and go back to your room.''' Prison physician Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanov </PERSON> said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> specialist examined and tested Ms. <PERSON> Boulatta </PERSON> but found nothing wrong. Some complaints about food and conditions seemed exaggerated. Prison Commissioner <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> rejected them. He called <PERSON> Tel </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> a model prison but conceded overcrowding and poor standards plague other facilities where anti-Israeli activists are held. `` Overcrowding is such that in some facilities prisoners have to stand in line for a bathroom,'' he said. <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> noted women in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monde </LOCATION> are allowed family visits and have access to radio, television, newspapers and some non-political books. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities have refused requests from reporters to visit other prisons, especially the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention center in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert, where several thousand <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists are living in tents, exposed to searing desert winds and heat. Most are held without trial for up to six months.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Reinstate Libel Case Against Izvestia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court refused Wednesday to reinstate a businessman's $ 250,000 libel award against the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, saying a foreign government publication can not be sued for libel. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also overturned $ 163,165 in breach-of-contract damages for <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> against Soviet trade organizations. Despite initially refusing to appear in court on the advice of their government, the organizations should have a chance to contest <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s claims, the court said. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had sold medical and laboratory products to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1970. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> said the government and two trading organizations, <PERSON> Medexport </PERSON> and <PERSON> Licensintorg </PERSON>, accepted and used hospital equipment in 1984 but failed to pay for it. In November 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> withdrew the company's license to maintain a business office in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The following week, an article in Izvestia accused Gregorian of smuggling, bribery and unethical business practices, and implied he had been spying for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the court said. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s lawsuit contended the newspaper article and the loss of his license were attempts to avoid payment for the hospital equipment. When Soviet officials refused to respond to the lawsuit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> found them in default and awarded damages. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> then seized a typewriter belonging to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and got an order allowing him to confiscate money in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank account held by a Soviet agency. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> later overturned the libel judgment. Wednesday's 3-0 ruling upheld that decision and ordered him to reconsider the contract claim.

<HEAD>Aussie Says The Title Ain't Enough To Leave Home For</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A retired Australian sheep shearer who inherited the title of Earl of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> toured his namesake city Wednesday, but even the prospect of sitting in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> was n't enough to make him stay. `` It's a splendid place, but we will be going back to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiennes-Clinton </PERSON>, 75, said after he and his wife <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, the new Countess of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, visited <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s castle, cathedral and prosperous shopping malls. <PERSON> Fiennes-Clinton </PERSON>, who also worked as a gold miner and milk deliveryman, said they decided to return home Thursday after discovering there is no ancestral home to go with the title _ only a seat in the hereditary House of Lords. `` This wo n't change our lives. We are still the same people and I hope it's not going to change me at all,'' said the earl, who calls his wife `` Mum.'' He was telephoned in January at his retirement village in <LOCATION> Bunbury </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and asked to call the College of Arms in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I had no idea what it was all about but I spoke to a man who said he would be the first to congratulate me,'' said the 18th Earl of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. `` I knew the title was in the family, but there are so many different branches it never occurred to me that I might inherit it. It is an old and honorable title and I would like to carry it on in the few years left to me.'' <PERSON> Fiennes-Clinton </PERSON> inherited the 16th-century title on Christmas Day upon the death in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> of a remote kinsman, the 10th Duke of <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. The family had fallen on hard times, and the duke was chiefly known as a collector of butterflies and moths. The old family seat, Clumber in <ORGANIZATION> Nottinghamshire </ORGANIZATION>, was pulled down as long ago as 1938, and its 3,800-acre park is now owned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for historic homes. As the duke was unmarried, the dukedom became extinct, but the lesser title of the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> earldom passed to the Australian, whose forebears had emigrated. The earl said he gave up full-time work 13 years ago and does not have the resources or desire to move to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The only cash benefit available to him would be a maximum payment of 57 pounds -LRB- $ 97 -RRB- daily if he attended the House of Lords and had to stay in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> overnight. `` We had some very nice letters from the city council assuring us of a warm welcome if we ever visited <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, so we came over to see it and to look into this title business,'' the earl said. The earl's only previous visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was in 1977 for the silver jubilee to mark Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s 25 years on the throne. He never thought of visiting <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> at that time. `` I grew up in the depression in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and there was no dole -LRB- welfare -RRB-. My first job was as a butcher, earning 10 shillings -LRB- $ 2 -RRB- a week. We used to kill out in the paddock and hang up the carcass in a tree,'' the earl said. He said he never found a crock of gold in his prospecting but before he retired, he was running the water supply for a large part of the country. The earl said, `` I was a widower when we were married and Mum was a widow. I have been lucky both times.'' He said he would like to take up his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> seat, but there was little prospect of it. The College of Arms said it could be five or six months before the necessary research was completed. The cost of confirming the title to make it legal and securing recognition by the queen could be $ 8,500. `` Mum and I are registered in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, but it is not all legal until the research has been done,'' the earl said.

 And on March 9, as you may remember, this commission filed its report and its recommendation. It was chaired by Ambassador <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON>, Judge <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON>, co-chaired by former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. In fact, the legislation now resulting from their recommendations and other ideas that I have _ legislation is being sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today. And just this morning, I issued an executive order announcing ethical principles for the conduct of executive branch employees. Both actions seek a common end: to raise ethical standards, to avoid conflicts of interest, and to ensure that the law is respected in fact and in appearance. There are those of course who say that public ethics and values can not be legislated. But they can, and I'm inclined to agree, you're never going to legislate away impropriety, or through legislation, guarantee that everybody _ everybody lives beyond the, you know, perception of criticism. But these values and ethics can be encouraged, respected and adhered to in government. Public service must reflect the best values of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and let me add that most public servants in my view do that _ and I have served in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and I have served in the executive branch as well. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> said, `` The whole art of government consists in being honest.'' And, yet, too often, simple honesty is not enough. Government rules have worked at cross purposes. Our regulations have been complicated and unequally applied. Our laws have been contradictory and unclear and we've spent more time trying to understand federal ethics laws than we have trying to live by them. My ethics program seeks to remedy these defects. How? By setting four objectives. First, to establish clear ethical principles. Second, to ensure uniform standards among all three branches of government. Third, to insist that these standards be fair and reasonable. And fourth, to ensure that these standards attract, not drive out, talented men and women to government. My ethics program first insists that ethical standards must be exacting enough to ensure that officials act with the utmost integrity, for the public's confidence is not ours to inherit. We must earn that confidence and it must be constantly renewed. With this in mind, I have placed a ban on outside income for non-career presidential appointees in the executive branch, including all employees in the immediate White House office. I am proposing expanded financial disclosure for all three branches of government and I have instructed my staff to perform a comprehensive review of federal campaign finance laws. Regarding the last _ and I have already reached one determination _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should extend for all members the prohibition against the conversion of political contributions for personal or office use. Political donations should not become a sort of individual retirement account for members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and I call on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to close this loophole and to close it this year. Modern democratic government works best when organized by strong political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowed by special interests, and we can best restore the role of the parties by limiting political action committees. PACs weaken the parties, restrain competition and deaden the political debate. And I believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by political action committees _ and I'll be consulting with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about that _ and I also oppose federal funding of congressional campaigns.

 <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> got outshouted and did n't smoke a single cigarette <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> went nose-to-nose, unbloodied this time, and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, who once wore a dress for a show on transvestites, did n't skirt the issue. And <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who does n't like the `` kinky'' stuff, defended them all. The occasion was a raucous, often-hilarious 90-minute program Wednesday pitting the four talk-show hosts and other television luminaries against leaders in the print media over what constitutes news, good taste and responsible journalism. Nobody, not even <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, a self-admitted `` yeller,'' seemed to have the last word. King took a stab at it. `` It's a big pie,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> columnist and <ORGANIZATION> Mutal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> television talk-show host. `` <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>'s producers may decide they want to do a lot of sex on their programs, or they want to do things that may be kinky. Suppose they do that? So what?'' `` I do n't have to watch,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` We each set out to do our programs. Same with newspapers. There's the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> paper and <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. And all the Americans have is choice.'' The program, produced by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>' annual convention, was videotaped and will be aired Wednesday night and on subsequent dates by public television stations. It was moderated by former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friendly </PERSON>, now with <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> Friendly started the fireworks by showing an excerpt from a program <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> did on sex surrogates, and telling his former student, `` It seems to me that what you're concentrating on is that ` kinky' business.'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>: `` I do lots of different programs. ... You are talking about 10 percent of what I do.'' Friendly: `` Mr. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, I looked at a hundred of your programs. I could have run a hundred of them and made the same point.'' `` What are you, Mr. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>?'' Friendly persisted. `` I'm a compassionate man ... a television talk-show host, a reporter, a journalist, a writer ...'' said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. Q: `` Who are your role models? A: `` There's a lot of -LRB- Walter -RRB- <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> in what I do. There's also <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. Friendly: `` That's a combination. <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, snapped that <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and the others are `` more show biz than you are journalists.'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> shot back: `` This is arrogant. This is hypocrisy.'' He demanded to know how much of the criticism of so-called trash television `` is based on pure parochialism? How much of it is based on the fact that I am your competition?'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: `` I do n't think you're a journalist.'' <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON>: `` Explain the difference.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: `` Well, I go out and I try to find out what I can that I think is important for society to know, for society to act on. ... <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>: `` You're a snob.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shales </PERSON>, television critic for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said `` We're not talking about what's journalism and what's not journalism. We're talking about what's good taste and what's bad taste, what's good manners and what's bad manners. And I think television now is overrun with bad taste and bad manners.'' The audience was shown another excerpt, from <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s program, in which a young member of the audience challenged the host's views on prison furloughs by noting that `` one of the central tenets of Christianity is foregiveness.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was shown retorting: `` Let me tell you something. More people have been killed in the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> ... they've all been killed by guys like you.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and the young man wound up screaming `` Murderer!'' at one another 10 times over. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> concluded the segment by raising his arm and inviting the youth to `` suck my armpit.'' Friendly: `` Did you really give that young man a chance to be heard?'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>: `` Absolutely. What am I supposed to do, write bland headlines on the 17th page of a newspaper? <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he is `` an advocate, not a host. ... I was raised in the generation of rock' n' roll. And we heard the lyrics over the music. The older folks here do n't seem to be able to hear the lyrics.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said `` the most reprehensible thing I see on any of these programs is <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> smoking his cigarette on television. ... <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, who could n't smoke during the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> appearance because of rules governing the hall, replied, `` That's the mentality of the super-liberal.'' King: `` If <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> wishes to commit suicide, that is his prerogative.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: `` You'd love for me to drop dead because it would be sensational for your newspaper.'' The capacity audience of about 500 newspaper publishers and executives also viewed the `` Donahue'' segment in which he donned a dress for a show on transvestites. Friendly taunted him about that, noting he once admired <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> for the way he handled shows. `` People have come to see you as a role model, and now you're making a fool of yourself,'' said Friendly. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> replied that `` I do not apologize for wanting to draw a crowd. I'm as interested in ratings as the people in the room are interested in circulation.'' Besides, said <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, `` I think it's a pretty good epitaph for somebody: ` Occasionally he went too far.'' Toward the end, virtually all the panelists were trying to be heard over each other. `` I find it extremely distasteful,'' said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, `` to listen to shouting.'' Friendly, in a not-so-veiled reference to a `` Geraldo'' episode, said `` I ca n't break people's noses to stop them.''

<HEAD>Scientists Clash On Whether Fusion Has Been Produced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ERICE, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British professor on Wednesday presented more details of an experiment he said produced nuclear fusion, but many scientists at an international conference said they were skeptical. The scientists said that even if fusion had been achieved, there were no guarantees it would provide a revolutionary new energy source. `` I'm warning people _ do n't sell your oil well yet,'' said physicist <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. About 100 scientists from around the world gathered Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Ettore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majorana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> to listen to British professor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who says he also achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using ordinary laboratory equipment. <PERSON> Fleishchmann </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, said when an electrical current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes in a glass beaker, the atoms apparently fused, generating four watts of energy for every watt used. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it will publish at least one of two research papers by scientists who claim to have independently generated nuclear fusion. Publication date was set for April 27, according to <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Garwin </PERSON>, an editor. For decades, scientists have spent millions of dollars searching for a practical way to achieve nuclear fusion because of its potential as an inexpensive, relatively clean and virtually inexhaustible source of energy. If scientists could harness fusion power, an ounce of `` heavy'' hydrogen could generate the energy equivalent of 70,000 gallons of gasoline, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. In the three weeks since <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and fellow researcher <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> made their fusion announcement, hundreds of scientists have rushed to duplicate the experiments. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities reported partial results. `` I'm somewhat disappointed and worried that in the past two weeks no one has solidly confirmed it,'' said <PERSON> Matthijs </PERSON> <PERSON> Broer </PERSON>, a physicist at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the team of <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> detailed their experiments Wednesday as scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> peppered them with highly technical questions Several scientists qestioned <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' claim that their fusion process produced four times as much energy as it used. `` I do n't think the heat they see is due to fusion,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who announced last month he had independently created cold nuclear fusion but produced only a miniscule energy release. Physicists said the Fleischmann-Pons experiment might have been simply a chemical reaction and therefore not significant as an energy source. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, however, said that only nuclear activity could account for the amount of energy released. Scientists also questioned whether <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> checked all the variables in their experiment. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> refused to answer several questions. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> acknowledged that more experiments were needed but said he was not concerned that his work had not been matched. `` I do n't see how people can expect to duplicate the results in a short time,'' he said. Nonetheless, physicists said they were taking the experiments seriously because of their potentially far-reaching impact and because of the scientists' solid reputations. Fusion is the process by which tremendous amounts of energy are released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse. In contrast, nuclear power plants get energy from fission, or the splitting of atoms. Standard fusion experiments have used extremely high temperatures and machines the size of two-story homes to force the hydrogen atoms to fuse. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Koonin </PERSON>, a theoretical nuclear physicist from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said if the discoveries were true, they could bring bad as well as good developments. `` If you can do nuclear physics in your kitchen, you have a severe proliferation problem,'' he said.

 A congressional commission on Wednesday recommended a permanent office in the federal health department to coordinate fights against so-called orphan diseases that afflict an estimated 20 million Americans. Orphan diseases are relatively rare ailments that, by definition, affect no more than 200,000 people. But because there are so many separate diseases, the total number of people suffering from them is larger than from many better-known ailments. Some diseases that qualify for orphan status are fairly well-known themselves _ such as autism, multiple schlerosis and Tay-Sachs diseases. Some, such as cholera, are common in the Third World, but rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Still others are obscure, such as <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s disease, a hereditary illness that causes liver and brain damage. The final report of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orphan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION>, established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, called for creation of a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orphan </ORGANIZATION> and Rare Diseases _ to be known as COORD _ within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. It would work to: _ Increase financing for biomedical research, training, fellowships and clinical research centers _ Provide access to affordable health care for all American and eliminate health insurance restrictions on pre-existing conditions _ Speed the government approval process for medications designed to help sufferers of rare diseases _ Create a centralized information datebase on rare diseases `` Research is critical, and we must make it clear to doctors and investigators that the tratment of rare diseases is a national priority,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoene </PERSON>, chairman of the commission.

<HEAD>Analysts Foresee Brownouts In Northeast This Summer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states are likely this summer to face a repeat of last year's temporary electricity shortages, and the squeeze may be a prelude to more widespread `` brownouts'' in the 1990s, energy analysts said Wednesday. `` What happens in the Northeast will be a harbinger for the rest of the country,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kujawa </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> analyst who helped direct a study on electric power trends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although electricity supplies for the peak use periods of summer are tightest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the power outlook for the nation as a whole is growing more uncertain, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yergin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and a partner in the study. The central problem is that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electricity demand has grown more rapidly than expected since 1985, while utilities have chosen not to add to their generating capacity, <PERSON> Kujawa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yergin </PERSON> told a news conference on the results of their study. The key question, they said, is who will build the generating capacity that will be needed in the 1990s. The answer is uncertain because utilities are wary of the financial risks involved in major new additions to plant capacity, while smaller power producers face an array of regulatory and other obstacles, they said. In the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, utilities in recent years have been forced to import power from the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. Last summer the problem was compounded by record heat. In the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, several thousand customers lost power for a weekend because of overheated transmission cables, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> about 10,000 customers lost power for a day. Other parts of the country have excess generating capacity, but if demand for electricity continues growing at the pace of recent years, constraints on supply could be felt in many areas, the analysts said. Environmental and regulatory issues also may compound the problem, they said. `` What is missing is an overall framework for balancing needs for new generating capacity with environmental concerns and the questions about who will pay,'' said <PERSON> Yergin </PERSON>.

 Soviet-born conductor <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, tearfully hailing a new era of artistic freedom in his homeland, announced Wednesday he will return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a concert tour with the National Symphony Orchestra next February. It will be his first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ except for a brief, unnoticed stopover in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> airport a few years ago _ since he fled into exile with his wife, soprano <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishnevskaya </PERSON>, in 1974. They were stripped of their Soviet citizenship four years later. <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, 62, a world-renowned cellist who has been music director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> since 1977, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> he was `` very excited and very nervous'' about visiting the homeland where he formerly was reviled and harassed by Soviet authorities. He and Soviet ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, tears streaming down their faces, embraced after the news conference. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> hinted broadly that if <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> gave a signal, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would be willing to initiate the process of restoring his Soviet citizenship. But <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> carefully avoided giving any indication of his future intentions, choosing instead to lavish praise on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies. `` The Soviet people have so much more freedom, so much more glasnost, than before Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' he said. `` For artistic freedom, there has been enormous change.'' <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> acknowledged that he had once vowed never to return to his homeland until there were major changes in the Soviet system. But he said Wednesday that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s far-reaching reforms `` give me the moral right to go there.'' After the National Symphony completes a two-week tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in late January and early February, <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> and the 103-member orchestra will fly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for two concerts in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in about a week. Although the concert programs for the Soviet tour were undecided, <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> said his first choices were <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>'s double concerto for cello and orchestra, with himself at the cello, and <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>'s Fifth Symphony, a powerful musical denunciation of the political and human rights abuses of the Stalin era. It was unclear Wednesday whether <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>'s wife would join the Soviet tour. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said the tour will be `` a very, very important page for his biography, for development of cultural exchanges ... and for deep changes in our society and our relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The ambassador said the issue of restoring <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>'s citizenship was `` a special question'' which `` depends now on the will of <PERSON> Maestro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> whether to begin the procedure. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> added: `` Let's hope the time will come when all the -LRB- legal -RRB- decisions will be taken according to the wishes of <PERSON> Maestro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, the orchestra's executive director, said it was only on Monday that he received the formal invitation from <LOCATION> Gosconcert </LOCATION>, the Soviet performing arts agency, for the National Symphony to make the tour. Although such a trip had been rumored for months, the orchestra players were not given the official news until <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> mounted the podium in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall for their regular Wednesday morning rehearsal. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said he considered it highly unlikely that <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> would seek to regain his Soviet citizenship and to return home permanently, leaving his lucrative job at the National Symphony, his concert recitals and recording commitments. In an emotional speech to orchestra members, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> noted that many of his Soviet contemporaries _ including <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>, pianist <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilels </PERSON> and violinist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oistrakh </PERSON> _ had died. He told his musicians that `` you have become my family.'' <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>'s troubles with Soviet authorities began when and his wife took Soviet author <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> into their home after the 1970 Nobel Prize winner was kicked out of the Soviet writers' union and deprived of his apartment. The couple's concerts and foreign tours were canceled, all recording sessions were halted and they suffered a total blackout in the Soviet press. After Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., intervened with Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, the couple obtained exit visas, fled to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1974 and decided to stay <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>'s rehabilitation began in 1987 when Soviet authorities allowed his sister, <PERSON> Veronika </PERSON>, to fly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to attend festivities marking the conductor's 60th birthday. In January, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> urged restoration of the couple's citizenship, and a senior member of the Soviet foreign ministry said in February that authorities would review the cases of people stripped of their citizenship. Last month, a favorable documentary on <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> and his wife was broadcast on Soviet television.

 A helicopter hit power lines Wednesday and crashed into the <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing two state police officers who were searching for a suicide victim, authorities and witnesses said. Scuba divers found the bodies of a state police corporal and a trooper in the wreckage of the five-passenger Bell Jet Ranger helicopter, police said. Their names were not immediately released. A witness, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, said she saw the crash from the <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> side of the river several miles north of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> border. `` It hit a wire that crosses the river then it exploded and fell into the water,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>. `` It broke up in pieces and pieces were floating down the river. We were all looking to see if there were any bodies. We did n't see any bodies, just the debris.'' State police spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> said the helicopter was being used to search for the body of a suicide victim who reportedly jumped from a bridge in the area several days earlier. <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> said it was the first crash of a state police helicopter since 1974. One trooper was killed in the 1974 crash; the cause of which was never determined. There was no hint of any factors that may have contributed to Wednesday's crash, which occurred about 9:45 a.m. in clear and calm weather.

 A ceremony planned to revive hope for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s safe return became a memorial service Wednesday, a day after his body was discovered in a Mexican grave dug by a voodoo cult of drug smugglers. `` I'm still kind of shocked about the whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, 21. `` I'm feeling a lot of different things _ anger, sadness.'' <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 20, were walking with <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> down a busy street in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the night the 21-year-old was abducted. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s body and 11 others were discovered Tuesday buried on a ranch south of the Mexican border. Police said the victims were killed by drug smugglers seeking demonic protection against police. Many Santa Fe residents who had worked to publicize <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s disappearance in an effort to find him gathered Wednesday to mourn the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> pre-med student's death `` We come today to pray for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>,'' the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeForke </PERSON> said at a brief ceremony held outside <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lourdes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> family's church. `` We come to pray for those other wonderful people who died so violently.'' About 150 children from the church school pinned yellow ribbons around two trees outside the church in remembrance of <LOCATION> Kilroy </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't imagine anything worse happening,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuebler </PERSON>, a friend of the family. After the church ceremony, the three friends with <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> the night he was taken said they wished now they had stayed at a party they were at instead of going drinking at a Mexican bar. `` We should have never gone over -LRB- the border -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>. The four attended different colleges but are from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, a small, quiet community about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. They all had gone to the beach in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for spring break and had ventured across the Mexican border for a late-night outing. They said <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> left the group after a stranger beckoned to him on the crowded <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> street in the early hours of March 14. But they said Wednesday they still ca n't recall the precise moment when, or exact spot where, <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> disappeared. Under hypnosis, <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> passed a man wearing a blue plaid shirt who motioned to <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> and called out. According to a friend of the <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> family, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> said under hypnosis that he went to a nearby bathroom and <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> was gone when he returned. The three said they did not recognize any of the suspects in pictures released by authorities Tuesday and Wednesday. The three expressed hope that <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s murderers would be prosecuted and punished. `` I think they deserve to get what he got,'' <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> lived for about 12 hours after his abduction and was slain with a machete, authorities said. Suspects in custody have confessed to removing <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s brain and spine and chopping off his legs, said <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s friends at the university in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> said his ambition to go to medical school drove him. `` School came first to him and he knew how to draw that line,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Padula </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s neighbor and a senior history major. `` He was just an average, typical incoming kid. He was nervous, he wanted to meet some girls, but he knew he had school work to do.'' `` He was very intelligent, a super-smart guy,'' said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shead </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UT </ORGANIZATION> psychology junior who attended high school with <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>. `` In high school I remember him winning all kinds of math and science awards.

<HEAD>WASHN: congressional campaigns.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 My legislative proposal also strengthens the rules against abusing the `` revolving door'' for private gain at the expense of public trust. These rules must not make government service a bar to productive work in the private sector, but they must prohibit the appearance of profiting from government service; and this must include the legislative branch as well. I am proposing a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges, while restricting their acceptance of honoraria. I also believe that honoraria for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be banned. And I believe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should have a pay increase. And I will not make a formal proposal on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until after I consult with the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the issue of congressional pay. There is no point, absolutely no point, in putting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed. And I will include, in those consultations, the question of a pay increase for certain executive branch positions, including specialized jobs like those out there at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. And I will strongly support pay increases for these jobs which are so important to this country. My ethics program's second goal recognizes that ethical consistency demands equitable standards across all three branches of government. And under our Constitution, every branch of government is equal, and none warrants preferential treatment. The same standard that applies to a staff person at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- should also apply to housing subcommittee staff on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. And a practice is either ethical or it is not. And if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is to be a level playing field, then every player should be treated the same. And therefore I am proposing that we must extend the independent counsel statute to cover the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I am also proposing that the federal statute that prohibits employees from taking actions that enhance their own financial interest be extended to cover legislative and judicial branch employees. There should also be an independent ethics office for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to be headed by a clearly non-partisan official confirmed by both houses. And I ask that the existing one-year post-employment `` cooling off'' period for the senior executive branch employees also apply to the legislative and the judicial branch. And then, there's the third objective of this ethics program. It insists that standards be reasonable and reflect good old-fashioned common sense. Some financial interests, for example, are too minor to create any meaningful conflict of interest at all. So, I want the Office of Government Ethics to have the authority to issue regulations authorizing waivers from these conflict of interest statutes. But at the same time, we're urging tougher penalties when intentional violations of criminal conflict of interest laws occur. We're asking officials from all three branches to simplify the forms that must be completed by prospective appointees, and I'm also requiring mandatory annual briefings on ethics for presidential appointees

 A <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Wednesday criticized Jewish demands to relocate a Carmelite convent away from the former <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has agreed to move the convent, but its failure to meet a promised Feb. 22 deadline has provoked an outcry from Jewish organizations. The newspaper <PERSON> Slowo </PERSON> <PERSON> Powszechne </PERSON> published an open letter from 1,375 people from <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION> `` protesting the pressure on the nuns to leave the building they occupy.'' <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION> is the Polish name for the city the Germans called <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. The newspaper does not represent the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. It is owned by a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> pro-government organization called PAX. Jews want the convent moved because <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, now a museum, holds special significance for them. About 2.8 million of the 6 million Jews killed in the Nazi holocaust died at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>' factory-like gas chambers and crematoria and those of <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>, a larger death camp a mile away that shared the same Nazi administration Victims came from throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, European Director of B'nai B'rith, said Jewish relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will `` remain frozen'' until the convent is moved. In a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> cited `` resistance by the Catholic rank and file and others in all of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' He said he doubts Polish assurances that a start will be made soon to build a new home for the convent's 14 nuns. <PERSON> Slowo </PERSON> <PERSON> Powszechne </PERSON> questioned any decision to move the convent, in a former theater used as a warehouse by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and located a few yards outside the camp's barbed wire fence. `` In the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp, it was mainly non-Jews who were murdered, above all Polish and POWs of other nationalities, and the extermination of Jews was being conducted in <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>,'' the paper said in a March 31 article. `` Therefore it is hard to understand why people of a different nationality and citizenship declare themselves so fiercely against a handful of nuns, living in a Polish city, on Polish soil, next to one of the biggest sites of martyrdom of Poles,'' the article said. More than 4 million people were put to death at the <LOCATION> Auschwitz-Birkenau </LOCATION> complex.

<HEAD>EEC Continuing to Push Grain Exports: USDA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> continues to push grain exports aggressively, with shipments expected to be at a record level this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. An analysis by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> exports of wheat and coarse grains such as barley and corn are expected to total 33.3 million metric tons in 1988-89, up 39 percent from 23.9 million tons last year. International trade years begin on July 1 for wheat and Oct. 1 for coarse grains. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39.5 bushels of corn. Wheat exports by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> are at a record 21 million tons, up from 15.3 million in 1987-88. But the coarse grains, mostly barley, also have grown and are forecast at 12.3 million tons against only 8.6 million tons last year. `` Over the past seven years, subsidized barley exports by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> have jumped by 150 percent,'' the report said. `` While EEC barley exports comprised less than 30 percent of world barley trade as recently as the early 1980s, their share is now almost 60 percent, a growth in exports that has come at least partially at the expense of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coarse grain market share.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's leading grain exporter, was forecast to have total wheat and coarse grain shipments of 103.4 million tons in the current trade year, up from 96.9 million tons in 1987-88, a 7 percent increase. Part of the growth reflects recent large corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and subsidized wheat sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is expected to import 37.5 million tons of wheat and coarse grains from all sources this year, up 2 million tons from the March forecast and 16 percent more than the 32.2 million tons imported in 1987-88. It also would be the most wheat and coarse grains imported by the Soviets since 55.4 million tons were bought in 1984-85. According to other <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures, the Soviets have bought about 17 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn for delivery in the year that began Oct. 1, all but 4 million tons of it corn. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought about 8.5 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery this year, about half of the 16.5 million tons <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is expected to import from all sources in 1988-89.

 My program's fourth objective is to attract and keep the best people in government by keeping federal ethics laws fair and balanced. An ethics law is not a weapon, a blunt instrument with which to pound a public servant. It's not a gag with which to silence the outspoken. It's a tool to ensure a government as honest as the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. We must not allow overly restrictive requirements to be abused, or to keep talented people from entering public service. And that is why we have carefully crafted new post-employment restrictions, and that's why we want to allow persons who are required to divest assets to defer their tax liability. My ethics program shows exactly where we are going and why: We seek to attract and keep the best and brightest in government. And by helping others, by building a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> honorably, ethically, we seek to show how public service is not the sum of our perks or possessions, but a measure of how we conduct ourselves and what we achieve. Come to think of it, this is a good code for all occupations, from high school to the highest callings in journalism and government. I am delighted to have the opportunity to present to you the principles of this ethics package. And obviously, I do n't want to see this powerful crowd escape without a pitch. I'd like to have your editorial support for the objectives that I've outlined here today. Thank you all very much and I'd be glad to take your questions. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>: The standard is that members of the society only are permitted to ask questions.

She is a 12-year-old sixth-grader _ and I'm a little nervous here _ 12-year old sixth-grader at <ORGANIZATION> Shepard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. And she asked me after I left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` Daddy, will I ever be president? Would I have a chance to be president like Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' She's black and also female. Do you envision, sir, a time when this country might be prepared to elect a black and-or female as president? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Yes, I do. I'd say to her, if I can make it, she can make it. But nevertheless _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ no but seriously, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, of course we're in changing times here. And the great thing is that she might, by her question, aspire to be president. And I hope that I can keep alive, for at least the time I'm in the White House, the concept, the honor of public service, the obligation to put something back into the system, and also the fact that if you get into the arena you get a very different perspective than when you're sitting outside. I always loved what <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> said, and this is a little off your question for your daughter, but he was listening to some debate with a bunch of staffers, I think it was, up on the hill. He said, `` Well, the problem is I never ran for sheriff.'' And it makes a difference. So, I hope that the question means she is interested and I hope that the progress that this country has made and will make in the future will guarantee that a black teen-ager today, female, might well be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A mysterious disease is striking infant pigs on some <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farms and in some cases 100 percent of the infected, weakened litters have died. Eight hog operations in <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have been hit by the disease, said farmer <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Haupert </PERSON>, whose farm was stricken. `` We probably lost 30 litters,'' <PERSON> Haupert </PERSON> said. `` We're spending a couple of thousand -LRB- dollars -RRB- a week on medication.'' <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scientists said other isolated cases have been recorded across the state. `` At this stage no one knows exactly what the disease is,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, professor of veterinary adult education at <LOCATION> Purdue </LOCATION>. The illness strikes sows with a loss of appetite during the latter part of their 113-day gestation period. Some farrows, or litters, are stillborn. The survivors have weakened heart membranes and cardiac muscles and a short life expectancy. In some hog operations, 100 percent of the weakened litters have died. Farmers and veterinarians first identified the disease about seven weeks ago, <PERSON> Haupert </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> researchers are studying victims of the disease, hoping to find links to similar illnesses that damaged hog populations in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> last year. `` <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> people called it the Plague of'88,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Keffaber </PERSON>, a veterinarian with the <ORGANIZATION> Swine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Roann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keffaber </PERSON> says infected herds in <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have 150 to 600 sows each, producing 3,000 to 12,000 piglets each year. `` It is n't killing big hogs,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnels </PERSON>, veterinary diagnostician for swine diseases at <LOCATION> Purdue </LOCATION>. The disease is similar to other illnesses that infect swine herds, such as <PERSON> Aujesky </PERSON>'s disease, more commonly known as pseudorabies. The disease should not affect entire herds. `` It's not going to be a wipe-out disease,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. Medication has done little to help his infected sows and piglets, <PERSON> Haupert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> suggested that hog producers with healthy swine near infected herds should isolate their animals. Pets should not be allowed to roam near an area where the disease has been prevalent and then return to a healthy herd.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said Wednesday he could n't explain the narrow margin by which he won an unprecedented fifth term of the nation's second-largest city `` You can speculate. I've won some close ones and lost some close ones. Winning is better. I am satisfied with the election,'' he said at a news conference. Pollsters had predicted the 71-year-old ex-cop and son of a sharecropper would coast to victory. Instead, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> found himself at one point Tuesday night barely maintaining the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff in June. `` Well, my friends. I've learned something in this election ... never take anything for granted,'' he told supporters in his 1 a.m. victory speech. `` I made a mistake during the campaign. I did n't make the kind of vigorous all-out effort I could have or should have,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` During the next four years, I will be a vigorous all-out mayor.'' A lackluster campaign and apparent voter apathy kept the turnout at 17 percent, the lowest in decades, according to the City Clerk's Office Just 328,194 of the city's 1.9 million registered voters cast ballots. Unofficial results showed <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> with 156,724 votes, or 52 percent, to freshman Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>'s 84,376 votes, or 27.99 percent. Former county Supervisor <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had 44,816 votes, or 15 percent. They were among 10 candidates. `` A little more time and more money, there could have been a difference,'' said <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who gathered only $ 150,000 for his campaign war chest compared to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s $ 2 million. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday he would continue his campaign to battle crime, drugs, traffic congestion and overdevelopment. `` The people are saying they are dissatisfied with the way this city has been managed,'' he said. He said the outcome of the election conveyed two statements from voters: `` The statement was that they are unhappy with the status quo and that they want change. And another statement was that only 20 percent of the people felt enough confidence in this election and their government to go on and continue to support it. `` The people are turned off with the process and I know that more now than ever. And that is why they stayed at home.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> earned the nickname `` Teflon mayor'' during the campaign because political polls showed the city's 3 million residents held him blameless for such things as rising crime, gang violence, pollution and traffic congestion. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said his upstart campaign showed that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was n't as invincible as he thought. The mayor drew his fiercest criticism in years just before the election when the city attorney's office announced an ethics investigation of him after learning the mayor performed consulting work with <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which did business with the city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> returned the $ 18,000 he was paid by the bank and called the charges politically motivated. In the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> rose to the rank of lieutenant before leaving police work for politics and election to the City Council. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, mayor since 1973, lost his first bid for the job in 1969 to incumbent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yorty </PERSON>. He has twice run unsuccessfully for governor, losing to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> in 1982 and 1986. Other mayoral candidates included <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who got 1.2 percent of the vote. The other candidates all received less than 1 percent.

<TEXT>
 Some employees of American embassies and consulates live too well at taxpayer expense, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said Wednesday after convincing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to limit luxury overseas accomodations. On a voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> added to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget bill <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>'s proposal to provide better-than-average rental houses to fewer foreign service workers. A 1987 report by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general indicated the perk of plush housing had been extended beyond its intended purpose of giving high-ranking officials appropriate homes in which to entertain official guests. According to <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>'s office, the inspector general report and a subsequent <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> inquiry discovered examples of apparent abuse of the housing perk: _ In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, two childless couples were given six-bedroom homes _ In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, a couple with one child lived in a five-bedroom home _ In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, every family routinely had rented homes with an extra bedroom A cross-check of 202 employees given the extra housing privelege showed 30 of them spent no money for official entertaining, <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>'s office said. The inspector general's report had indicated the perk of upgraded housing, excluding the cost of maintaining homes for ambassadors and deputy ambassadors, cost the government an average $ 48,000 per embassy. In an interview in his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> said pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to water down his proposal came within 30 minutes of his distributing courtesy copies to colleagues. Even if the amendment does n't survive the rest of the legislative procedure _ it could be axed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or in a conference committee _ `` the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has the message,'' he said. `` You've got to put the bright light on them sometimes.'' The amendment is attached to a measure authorizing $ 4.8 billion in fiscal 1990 and $ 4.96 billion in 1991 for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and other federal international agencies.

 The killings linked to an alleged voodoo cult of drug smugglers appear to be part of mixture of rites with African and European elements, an anthropologist said Wednesday. Although human sacrifices were performed regularly in pre-Columbian times, `` human ritual slayings are unheard of in modern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitaine </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Veracruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthropology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION>. `` Animal sacrifices are very common, however, as part of the widespread superstition and witchcraft that exists in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> nowadays,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Police in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, have uncovered more than a dozen human bodies apparently used by drug smugglers practicing voodoo rites popularly known as santeria. The smugglers apparently tried to offer the souls of others, human and animal, to protect themselves from arrest and harm. Police had arrested several people and were looking on Wednesday for the alleged ringleader, a Cuban in his late 40s named <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> apparently introduced elements of santeria, a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> Hispanic version of voodoo influenced by Roman Catholicism, to the area. Police said the victims' bodies were mutilated and that they found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones in the ranch. `` I'll have to have more information and maybe look for myself before I can analyze this further, but from what I saw on television last night this does n't seem to be any Mexican occult ritual,'' said <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON>, who specializes in pre-Hispanic cultures and their religious influence in modern times. `` They seem to be a Russian salad of rites from various satanic cults which the people indulged in, probably crazed by drugs,'' he said. <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said `` lamps'' found at the ranch were actually small shot glasses blackened with soot and filled with wax, with a wick stuck in the middle. `` These are quite common in Mexican witchcraft and are typical of the European-Roman Catholic black magic rites inherited from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But other elements like the kettles seem part of the Haitian-African rituals practiced in many places, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said the African rituals were brought by slaves from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and adapted locally to the Catholic religion. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> it's known as `` macumbe,'' and in the Hispanic <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, it's called santeria `` They vary from place to place, but the main elements are almost all the same,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. Santeria is well-known in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Latin community, especially since 125,000 Cubans immigrated from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> in 1980. Animal rights activists there have complained that practitioners torture animals and may steal and slaughter pets. Santeria priests say animal sacrifice is legal under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law if done humanely. Priests say they kill only chickens, pigs or goats _ never cats or dogs _ and dispose of remains in a sanitary manner. <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has dozens of santeria shops, called `` botanicas,'' that sell statues of gods, books of incantations, colored beads and scents. In Mexican marketplaces, herbs and other items are sold for witchcraft and the work of witch doctors, who are powerful figures in rural areas where Indians still live much the way they did before the Spanish came. During the Aztec Indian empire and other earlier cultures, priests sacrificed slaves or prisoners of war to the gods by cutting their hearts out or flaying or skinning them alive. `` Usually this involved a ceremony, usually a fertility rite,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. `` In modern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> witchcraft is very common and there are two types _ black magic, which mainly tries to cause harm to an enemy, and white magic, which seeks to do good like curing a disease,'' he said. `` And, yes ... it is common to sacrifice animals like black roosters,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said.

 The self-declared state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, though unrecognized by most of the world, has tended to one governmental chore by declaring its own version of daylight-saving time starting April 15. PLO-backed leaders of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> called for residents of the territories to set their clocks ahead one hour for `` summer time in the state of Palestine'' to last until Sept. 15.

Israelis do not turn their clocks forward until April 29, after the Jewish Passover holidays.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported that he earned $ 155,662 last year from business holdings kept in a blind trust, a sum well above his $ 115,000 vice presidential salary. In the federal tax form that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> filed jointly with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, the pair reported an adjusted gross income of $ 287,171. That was based on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 155,662 in interest-and-dividend earnings through partnerships and other interests, masked by the blind trust, and his government salary. Also included was $ 7,147 in other interest along with $ 12,362 in income from other sources, primarily profits that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made from his partnership in a firm that leased a liquefied natural gas transportation barge in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The Bushes paid taxes equivalent to 21.6 percent of their total income, which was nearly $ 30,000 below the $ 308,396 income of 1987. The government withheld $ 29,480 from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s income last year, and he made $ 65,404 in quarterly payments based on assuming what his tax liability would be. When his 1988 federal tax liability of $ 62,106 was deducted from the $ 94,884 total in money withheld or prepaid, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had overpaid by $ 32,778. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he applied $ 15,000 to next year's tax liability and pocketed $ 17,778. Meanwhile, the office of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> released the tax forms filed jointly by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. The Quayles, who records show hold assets worth more than $ 1.4 million, reported an adjusted gross income of $ 156,546 last year, the bulk of that coming from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s $ 89,500 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salary. But the form also showed that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, while a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, earned $ 52,797 in speaking honoraria last year _ $ 16,997 above the maximum senators may accept. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> listed charitable contributions totaling $ 17,304, or just a little above the $ 16,997 in speaking fees that he could not keep for himself. The vice president's press secretary, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had written off the excess speaker's fees in an appropriate fashion. `` He earned more in honoraria than he's allowed to keep, so he gave all the excess to charity,'' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> gained no tax advantage by writing off the extra speaking fees as charitable contributions, saying `` you have -LRB- approximately -RRB- $ 17,000 more in income and $ 17,000 more in deductions -LRB- to report -RRB-, so it's a wash.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> earned all his speaking fees before August, when the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nominated him to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate The balance of his $ 156,546 income came from interest, dividends and capital gains relating to his family's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also made $ 2,000 as a director of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> _ a position he would have to relinquish under ethics legislation that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday Estimates on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s net worth have varied substantially, although records show that the president, who made the bulk of his money as an oil entrepreneur in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has assets worth well over $ 2 million. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I would say, however, that reports of his wealth are vastly over-estimated. Most of his net worth is in the <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -RRB- estate.'' In his tax return, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported a net capital gains loss, through his blind trust transactions, of $ 3,480. The nature of the loss was not divulged. After availing himself of the standard $ 3,000 deduction allowed by law for such losses, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a $ 458 loss which was carried over to next year's capital gains losses _ a procedure permitted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Tax Code. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid only $ 3,328 in state and local income taxes, with most of that going to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in payment of taxes based on the income generated by his partnership in the barge-leasing leasing enterprise. The president's legal home address is in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has no state income tax. He did pay some taxes to other states, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, but that, too, is sheltered from disclosure by the blind trust. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also paid $ 19,034 in real estate taxes, with the bulk of that involving the Walker's Point estate at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> and the remainder involving taxes paid on a vacant lot he owns in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. And he paid $ 277 in miscellaneous personal property fees on a pickup truck, a Bronco vehicle and a boat he has in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The Bushes donated $ 12,468 to charity, including contributions to a host of church and civic organizations and donations to foundations established in the memory of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> policeman killed in the line of duty, and in honor of the late <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grogan </PERSON>, the wife of presidential aide <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersmeyer </PERSON>, who died of cancer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reported $ 9,998 in business-related expenses, of which $ 9,712 was reimbursed by the government. The vice president is given a $ 10,000 allowance for such expenses. But $ 286 of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claimed expenses were disallowed, and so he was therefore able to deduct this from his tax liability <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did know what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expense submissions were rejected.

 Two young brothers carried picket signs to protest a judge's order returning their younger brother and sister to their mother, and threatened to sue the state if their siblings are harmed. `` We're doing all we can to make -LRB- the judge -RRB- change his mind. If they go back and die, I'm going to sue the state. If they go back, they'll get in a lot of trouble,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, 12. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, 13, both of <LOCATION> Willmar </LOCATION>, picketed after school Tuesday outside the <LOCATION> Kandiyohi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> protesting the order by District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> sending their brother and sister, aged 9 and 10, to live with their mother. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> has n't been receptive. `` We wrote a couple of letters to the judge, but he wo n't listen,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> `` I think he really does not care.'' Not true, says <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON>. `` Nobody wants to put anybody in an abusive home. It's a tough case,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON>, citing confidentiality, declined to comment on the case but said the order sending the two children to their mother is `` still up in the air.'' `` I'm very sensitive to this being a juvenile, confidential case,'' said <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON>. `` I'm not sure what the final result is going to be.'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said his order is contingent upon the children's mother meeting certain conditions before the children are returned, such as having a home `` I would n't characterize it as an abusive home,'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said. He said he considered recommendations from all interested parties, including social workers, family members and guardians, in making his decision. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said that when his younger brother and sister visited their mother recently, she told them they were going to move and he'd never see them again. The boys said they and their younger brother and sister, as well as another brother, have been living in separate foster homes for about seven years. `` Our dad said he could n't take care of all of us,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said, adding that his foster home is with `` a real nice family.'' He said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> likes his foster family, too.

 Two urns holding soil from the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> graves of 4,500 Polish officers were displayed at the army museum Wednesday, indicating official <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has come to terms with the crime widely attributed to the Soviets. A trickle of mourners, some in tears, others carrying flowers, visited the two small black containers, which Poles say have come to symbolize Soviet crimes against their country. `` It is important historically that these facts are revealed,'' said a widow who stood before the memorial with her daughter. The officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the reserves in World War II, were shot in the back of head and dumped in mass graves in <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, near the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>. For years, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist government stuck by the Soviet accounting of events whereby the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> committed the murders in 1941 after invading the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But most historians believe the Soviet secret police carried out the massacre in 1940, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were still allied. And in recent months, the official Polish position has changed. In 1987, Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed to appoint a joint commission to study `` blank spots'' in the two countries' histories. Polish members of the commission issued tentative conclusions, based on what officials called circumstantial evidence, pointing to Soviet responsiblity. Soviet members reportedly are still studying the case. The government press has written about <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, a subject that had been forbidden but not forgotten by Poles. The urns were brought from <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> on April 5 by a delegation of victims' families. They were placed first at a garrison church in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> where a Mass was celebrated by army chaplains. On Wednesday, the urns were moved to the army museum, where they were placed on a pedestal bearing the words `` Soil from the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> graves'' and draped with a long banner in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s red and white colors. Overhead are hung embroidered flags from army units mustered in pre-communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> before World War II. Officers stand at attention on either side. In ceremonies scheduled for Tuesday, one urn will be placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and another on a monument to the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> victims at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Powazki cemetery. The wording on the monument, which previously blamed `` Hitlerite fascists,'' is being changed, but the government has not said what the new phrasing will be.

 Seigenthaler: Mr. President there are three microphones. I see <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> here. Q. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, The <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Advertiser. How do you square that excellent program you've just outlined to us, sir, with the Tower nomination and your support right to the end? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I see no contradiction whatsoever. As you know, I do n't want to relive the Tower question, but I believe that judgments should be made on _ on reality, not on perception. I did n't like what happened, and I do n't think that it's any conflict at all with any of the four points I have made here today. So I'd simply _ and nothing convinced me from the hearings of that, because I do n't think that there was anything that was pointed out too definitively that conflicts with what we've talked about here. So I just would respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reached, and I'm going to work with them. We're going forward now, and they promptly confirmed <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, but I just do n't see any conflict there, at all. Seigenthaler: I ca n't see who it is at the far microphone, but if you'll identify yourself. Q. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakenhan </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Mr. President, this week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee reported out a bill which most of the people in this room think would severely limit and hamper the First Amendment. It would pass into law the so-called Fairness Doctrine. The head-counters say that it will probably go through both chambers quite comfortably. Will you stand with your predecessor in vetoing that bill should it come to you? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, I do n't want to indicate that a veto will be necessary, but I will stand with the previous position that I was a part of in the last administration, yes, sir. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Q. -LRB- Name inaudible -RRB- _ with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Mr. President, since you've taken office, you've greatly increased the access to the presidency on the part of the press. And you have taken such initiatives as hosting small dinners in your private residence with reporters and editors. This has sparked some debate _ and if I can frame it, if you'll permit me to frame it in the spirit of our morning session with <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and others _ `` Is he trying to woo us, and may he succeed in seducing us?'' Mr. President, if you would explain your philosophy to press coverage of the presidency and the relationship with your administration. I realize that some of the debate is probably our ability to complain, no matter what kind of access we get. But I'd like to hear your views of your relationship to the media. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, in the first place, when <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I invite a reporter and her spouse, or a reporter and his spouse, to the White House for an upstairs dinner, we're not _ we're doing that not to seduce the press. -LRB- Light laughter. -RRB- We're treating them as human beings. And one of the reasons _ you've asked my press policy. One of the reasons I do n't take questions over the sound of the helicopter blades out there is I want to treat the press with the dignity to which it is entitled. And if you have to get your question answered by screaming at me when I do n't want to answer it, you do n't look very good, and I do n't think it's very good for the White House.

 Two consumer groups on Wednesday urged motorists to boycott <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> gasoline in response to the company's Alaskan oil spill and subsequent gas price increases The <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> and Citizen Action urged holders of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> credit cards to cut up their cards and send half of each to the `` Make Exxon Pay'' boycott office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The organizations said they would deliver the card pieces to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> at the company's annual meeting May 18 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` We are asking consumers to boycott Exxon not just because of its environmental irresponsibility and recklessness, but also because the company has raised its gasoline prices to make consumers help pay for the clean-up'' of the March 24 oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, spokesman for the groups. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> wholesale gasoline prices had risen more than 11 cents per gallon since the accident, giving <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> $ 25 million in additional revenue. He acknowledged that other oil companies' gasoline prices also had risen in recent weeks, but said this `` does not in any way diminish the need to teach <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> a lesson.'' The rise in gas prices following the disruption of Alaskan crude oil deliveries to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refineries also has stirred concern on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has said his <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is investigating whether the price increases were justified. In response to the consumer groups' boycott call, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters issued a statement reiterating its regret about the oil spill. `` All of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that our effort in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will convince them that we continue to be a responsible company and one people like to do business with,'' the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> is comprised of labor unions, consumer organizations and senior citizen groups.

<TEXT>
 City authorities on Wednesday suspended the head of a hospital department where four nursing aides confessed to at least 49 `` mercy killings,'' and they ordered the exhumation of bodies of several presumed victims. Dr. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON>'s suspension follows mounting criticism of his reported refusal to cooperate with police during an investigation last year to find evidence of mass killings at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s Lainz hospital. Four assistant nurses arrested since Friday have confessed to killing at least 49 elderly patients with overdoses of medicine or by forcing water into their lungs. Most victims were in their 80s. Newspaper reports say the lives of 22 of the 49 victims could have been saved if <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> had cooperated last year, when senior investigator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said police met `` a wall of silence'' at the hospital. <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> defended his conduct on a national television discussion Wednesday evening. <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> said he was told last April by a female doctor that another doctor, Dr. <PERSON> Waschnig </PERSON>, learned in a wine bar of rumors that patients were being `` put to rest'' by assistant nurses. <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> said he alerted doctors and senior nurses to the rumor, and ordered an immediate blood test on an 84-year-old woman who died unexpectedly days later. The blood test results prompted him to advise city medical officials and the hospital director, and police were called, <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> said. A later forensic test on the 84-year-old woman turned up nothing suspicious, officials have said. <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> said Dr. <PERSON> Waschnig </PERSON>'s name was mentioned in the presence of police, although he was not identified as the source of the rumor. A police report says <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> refused to give investigators the name of the doctor who alerted him to the possible killings. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s largest daily newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kronen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, asserted that if <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> and the second doctor `` had not kept quiet, it would fairly certainly have been possible to stop the series of murders a year ago.'' `` As it was, however, the sadistic nurses could kill another 22 people,'' the newspaper said. Police have not confirmed media reports that 22 people were killed in the past year. The killings reportedly began in 1983 at <LOCATION> Lainz </LOCATION> hospital's Pavilion Five, dubbed `` the Death Pavilion'' by <PERSON> Neue </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> On Wednesday, patients sat in stairwells, smoking cigarettes and whispering about <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON>'s suspension, but they refused to talk to reporters. So did Pesendorfer and hospital officials. The hospital refused to describe the function of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> ran. However, it appears to practice general medicine on people suffering ailments related to old age. Mayor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilk </PERSON> said he suspended <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> `` on the grounds of the results to date of the police investigations.'' He declined further comment. In a statement read on the television discussion program, <PERSON> Zilk </PERSON> added the suspension was intended not as a judgement of <LOCATION> Pesendorfer </LOCATION> but to facilitate further inquiries and encourage his staff to speak out. <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacher </PERSON>, chief of the city's health department, said the suspension was linked to `` lingering lack of clarity'' over the investigation. <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON> consistently has defended his role and the conduct of officials in his department at <LOCATION> Lainz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest hospital, since first word of the killings on Friday. Assistant nurses <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, 25, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Leidorf </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Waltraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 30, were detained Friday. Another assistant nurse, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, 50, was detained Sunday after Ms. <PERSON> Ferrada-Avendano </PERSON> went to police. She too was arrested after she admitted witnessing one of the killings, <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said. Three other witnesses have come forward. <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said two say they witnessed killings as patients in the hospital, while another _ the daughter of a patient who has since died _ reported her mother told her about killings at the hospital. The nursing aides have not been charged, but police say Ms. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> alone has confessed to killing 39 patients. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON>, hinted it may be difficult for police to get any murder charges to stick. He was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as speaking of `` so-called confessions'' to police and noting state prosecutors will have to prove `` the murder really did happen'' because of his client's actions In an apparent attempt to get more evidence, city authorities late Wednesday ordered the exhumation of the bodies of several presumed victims. Officials declined to identify the bodies or say how many will be exhumed. Pesendorfer is the first doctor or official suspended because of the killings.

<HEAD>Bennett Asks For More Money, And More Freedom to Spend It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 National drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday for a $ 12 million budget in 1990, an $ 8.5 million increase over the current budget, and freedom to allocate the money as he sees fit. `` Why this amount? Why this growth? Given the fact that the 1989 appropriation of $ 3.5 million was intended to cover our operations for only a portion of the year, and given the substantial tasks facing this office, I believe it will become apparent that the $ 12 million proposed for 1990 is a very reasonable request,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and general government. `` What's more, I believe it is vital to the advancement of this nation's drug control efforts,'' he said, adding that it would be spent to provide for 64 jobs, 24 more positions than appeared in the budget proposed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January. In addition, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> requested a change in the appropriation language to remove the earmarking of $ 7 million for staff and $ 5 million for research to give him greater flexibility in how the money is spent. `` It is not clear to me yet what the size of this office should be, what the strategy should be,'' he told the panel, adding, however, `` I intend to keep this office lean and mean. I do not intend to build a bureaucracy.'' Asked why he wanted to merge the funds, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` There's a lot of research going on in the 30-odd agencies involved in these areas. It's possible, he said, that his office would not need to spend money for research but could use that money instead for personnel. Although he was pressed repeatedly by panel members for specific plans for various agencies and budgets, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> declined to provide details. `` I'm essentially ... listening now to what people tell me. ... I'm getting people's perspectives'' on how to structure the national drug control strategy, which by law he must provide 180 days from his swearing in March 13. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the strategy, which will include priorities and financing requests, will be completed by Sept. 5. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he has a `` cordial'' relationship with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, even though one of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s top aides, and not the mayor himself, is handling the district's involvement with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office. In releasing a multi-million dollar federal plan designed to help the city curb its record murder rate, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> lashed out Monday at <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s government, and accused the city of letting the drug problem grow `` out of control.'' `` I do n't want us to get sidetracked by any personalities or debates,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said Wednesday after a meeting with other Washington-area local government officials. `` The issue is n't <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of the city government _ the issue is the international trafficking of drugs.

 A car bomb exploded next to a police station Wednesday, killing a young Roman Catholic woman and injuring 31 civilians and nine police officers, authorities said. The hospital where the victims were taken received four warnings of a blast at the police station, but all came after the bomb exploded in a stolen van parked next to the station in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Warrenpoint </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>. Suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The group did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite the province, where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-to-2, with the <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, has urged the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to be more careful in its attacks. On Wednesday, he said: `` We are against the killing of civilians. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> does not condone in the strongest possible terms what happened at <LOCATION> Warrenpoint </LOCATION> this morning.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 20, an office worker at a hardware store next to the police station, died in the explosion. Police said most of the injured were treated and released but that five remained hospitalized at <LOCATION> Daisy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>. The hospital received the first bomb warning nine minutes after the explosion, police said. Police said the blast ignited gas cylinders in the yard next to the police station and touched off further explosions and a huge fire. Windows up to a mile away were shattered, and the police station and nearby buildings were heavily damaged, police said. <LOCATION> Warrenpoint </LOCATION> has a population of 6,500 and is less than a mile from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s border with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> party, said `` people who carry out this sort of attack listen to nobody. They simply have a murderous desire in their hearts to kill.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warrenpoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> condemned the attack as `` total madness.'' He said the town had just started to attract tourists, `` and now this happens.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killed 18 British army soldiers in an ambush outside <LOCATION> Warrenpoint </LOCATION> on Aug. 27, 1979. The same day, Lord <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountbatten </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s last viceroy and a cousin of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was killed in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb blast aboard his yacht off the coast of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 The number of Americans who know their cholesterol level has nearly doubled in a year, and more than four in 10 say they have changed their eating habits to cut their cholesterol, a poll said Tuesday. Among 1,016 people age 18 or over polled by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in January, 31 percent said they knew their cholesterol level. A year before, when Gallup asked the same question, just 17 percent knew.

The survey, conducted Jan. 9-22 and released by the organization Tuesday, found that about two-thirds of respondents said they had taken a blood test to check their cholesterol level, and four in 10 said they had changed their diet or eating habits in the past two years to reduce their cholesterol. The hospital group sponsors `` Countdown <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' at which about 450 of its member hospitals offer free cholesterol and blood pressure tests. The event this year is April 26; more than 400,000 people took the tests last year. The poll had a 3-point margin of sampling error.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it plans enforcement action against more than 1,000 pilots who failed to report required information about alcohol or drug-related convictions. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the pilots could have their medical certificates revoked and their airman certificates suspended or revoked, depending on the seriousness of the violations. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said more than 6,000 names were obtained through computer matches of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> medical records and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> criminal history records and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state motor vehicle records. The search, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said in a written statement, turned up `` a significant number of airmen who appear to have falsified their applications for airmen medical certification with regard to drug convictions and drug or alcohol-related traffic convictions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said that because of the large number of cases, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> plans to focus its enforcement effort only on cases involving convictions since Feb. 17, 1984, although it may take action in severe older cases. The agency said it would also take action where necessary in cases involving drug convictions but no falsification of applications for <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> certificates. In a separate matter, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> proposed a new safety rule that would increase the number of flight attendants that must be present to supervise passenger boarding operations when an airliner is on the ground. The proposal would mainly affect mid-size airline aircraft with 101 to 150 seats, and in many cases would require two attendants to remain on board instead of one. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it was publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register this week and soliciting comment.

 And so what I've tried to do is have enough availability _ in fact, I'm going to cross this one up as a press conference for the record _ one more notch _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ so I can go to those doubters and say, `` Look, we want to be accessible.'' But I would separate out _ you know, I _ I do n't know what we'll do at Christmas But what <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I try to do at our house is say, `` Hey, you and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, or whoever it is, come on to the Christmas party'' and not have to have it all categorized and so afraid that somebody thinks I'm trying to seduce some reporter that you have to be treated as something so different than anybody else. And so, availability; do n't get mad when they ask stuff you do n't like; and treat people as you would _ whatever walk of life, or whatever occupation they come from. And if it's misinterpreted, fine, you do n't have to come. And so I understand _ I remember back a few years ago when one of the great news organizations said, `` OK, we're no longer going to be used. We do n't want any backgrounders or off-the-record.'' Lasted about 30 seconds _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ and those reporters came trooping back in. And _ but I respected that, if that's the way they want to do it. But please believe me that when we do it this way it's what we feel is appropriate, and if it's not, I'll sure _ you know, I think we'll take a hit _ but I'm unpersuaded by the gentle logic of <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and whoever that other guy was that was here _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I believe _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ on that question.

Would you comment on that, please? Bush: Well, let me comment on the last part first _ and I know of no such retaliatory action. I think it would be impossible to do anyway, and it would be wrong. And certainly, I would condemn anyone in our administration that had any hand in anything of that nature. Secondly, there is nothing in this ethics package, when I call for an even playing field _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, executive branch and judicial branch to have the same standards _ that should, in any way directly or indirectly, be interpreted as intervening in the matter now before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee.

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Claim To Duplicate U.S. Fusion Experiments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature in tests similar to experiments carried out in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Wednesday. `` Under the guidance of Professor <PERSON> Runar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzmin </PERSON>, researchers at the solid matter laboratory of the physics department of <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have confirmed the experiments of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleagues to obtain nuclear fusion at room temperature,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Two weeks ago, scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southhampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said they had achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature. Their experiments used a rod of palladium and a coil of platinum immersed in a beaker of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen commonly found in seawater, officials at the universities said. However, many experts reamined unconvinced that fusion actually took place in those experiments, and some suggested the phenomenon may be something new to science. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> indicated similarities between the experiments at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the campuses in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuzmin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that researchers inserted electrodes _ an anode and a cathode _ into a beaker of deuterium. The electrodes were manufactured from titanium and palladium, he said. The researchers then applied electric current to the electrodes until the water reached a boiling point `` and registered the release of fast neutrons with the help of a detector,'' the news agency said. `` It is precisely judging by the release of neutrons that one can assert with confidence that the nuclear fusion reaction actually takes place,'' <PERSON> Kuzmin </PERSON> said. He said the researchers made no attempt to calculate the ratio of energy applied to the energy released. `` According to evaluations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists, this reaction probably releases four times more energy than is expended to ` stimulate' nuclear fusion,'' he said. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Logunov </PERSON>, a rector of <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that a program of fundamental research into the new type of fusion will begin in the near future. At this stage, <PERSON> Logunov </PERSON> said, `` it is difficult to say whether the reaction would be economically profitable for obtaining energy on an industrial scale.''

<HEAD>North Says He Destroyed Memos to Protect Reagan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified Wednesday he thought he was protecting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he altered six Iran-Contra `` problem memos'' before investigators from the attorney general could get a look at them. Appearing pale and on edge in his fifth day on the witness stand, <PERSON> North </PERSON> hotly denied he `` had been working in a den of thieves'' at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. And he said the documents he destroyed `` were only the tip of the iceberg'' compared to those in the hands of prosecutors. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he was present, as the Iran-Contra affair was about to burst into public view, when National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> tore up a December 1985 presidential `` finding'' retroactively authorizing a shipment of missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in a failed effort to win the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s testimony on destroying the document _ making no mention of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s presence _ was one of the more startling revelations during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987. `` Where is the finding now?'' Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked North. A. I do n't know. Q. What happened to it? A. I'm told it was destroyed. Q. By whom? A. Admiral Poindexter Q. When? A. Nov. 21-22-23 -LRB- 1986 -RRB-. Q. When did you learn Admiral <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroyed the finding. A. I was there. I saw him tear it in two. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said high administration officials did not want the finding exposed. It would have been an embarrassment, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, `` because it looked like an arms-for-hostages swap.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said often he would not negotiate with kidnappers. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> knew `` it was the only version in existence ... the only paper in the entire world'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s authorization <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he did n't know. During the congressional hearings <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> said of the finding, `` I thought it was politically embarrassing so I decided to tear it up, tore it up, and put it in a burn bag behind my desk.'' That same day, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, Nov. 21, his former boss <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> reminded him to sanitize six notes which indicated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s or <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s knowledge of what <PERSON> North </PERSON> had done for the Nicaraguan Contras. North testified he had orders of a year's standing from <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to alter the memos. A list of the documents _ all memos he had sent to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> on the internal <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> computer network _ had been taped to his computer terminal that whole year, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` The gist of what he wanted removed from the documents was language that would indicate his knowledge or the president's knowledge about my activities in this time frame,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified North had been coordinating efforts to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and to help the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had ordered an embargo on weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned official aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he authorized selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but did n't know of the diversion of some profits to the rebels. On Nov. 21, 1986, as the secret Iran-Contra dealings were beginning to unravel in public, <PERSON> North </PERSON> told his secretary, <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, to make the changes in the memos. This was a day before aides to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> searched <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s office. `` Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> asked me if certain things had been taken care of,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` He asked me point blank whether it had been done and I said, ` No, not yet,' that I would get around to it.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had left the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> the previous December, but <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he felt he had to carry out the order. `` I had been led to believe that everything I was doing was done at the direction of the president,'' he said. `` You had been told by the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to destroy documents _ explain how you had come to that conclusion?'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked. `` Because everything I had done that was described in the documents on this list I had been told was at the direction of the president,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> replied. North's testimony contradicts <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who said it was <PERSON> North </PERSON> who proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still considers North, a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, a national hero because `` anybody that gets a Purple Heart, sheds his blood fighting for his country, deserves to be called an American hero.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to answer questions about trial documents concerning his own involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, saying he does n't want to prejudice <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial. He said again Wednesday, `` The last thing I want to do is intervene in that matter that is now before the courts.'' A document introduced at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s criminal trial this week seemingly supported the idea that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then vice president, knew in 1985 that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was being rewarded for its support of the Contras with additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The document, a Feb. 20, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> draft memo, bears the handwritten notation, `` We want VP to also discuss this matter'' with Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>, next to a typewritten section detailing the tradeoff. A 42-page summary of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Iran-Contra dealing with other countries was introduced at the trial last week. It said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> and told him about enhanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid shortly after the arrangement was made for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to help the Contras, but it did not say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew of the connection. Three of the 12 charges on which North is being tried concern the altering of documents. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, like <PERSON> North </PERSON> a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who had served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, hammered away on Wednesday at the circumstances of the changed memos. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> North </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> for sending a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that falsely denied the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff was assisting the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` I wrote a number of other letters'' that were `` inconsistent with the facts. ... I just simply do not believe I wrote this letter.''

 At 5 a.m., <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> stepped onto the balcony of his fourth-floor hotel room in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> and looked down onto a street filled with protesters, Soviet soldiers and armored personal carriers. As <PERSON> Raley </PERSON>, an educator from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and his wife watched in the glow of streetlights, what began as a demonstration for independence for <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> turned into a bloody clash that left at least 19 people dead. `` At first, we were n't concerned when we heard the loud noises,'' <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> said. `` But then we saw Soviet soldiers with metal shields and night sticks, 10 to 15 soldiers deep, filling the entire street. `` They were literally pushing hundreds of students, who at that time started throwing stones.'' <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> said the soldiers were followed by tanks. He said students who were beaten during the fighting ducked into alleyways and shops along <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s main thoroughfare, <LOCATION> Rustaveli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, for medical care. He said 15 ambulances came to help the injured after the tanks ran through the street. <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> was accompanying 15 high school exchange students from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, who had been staying with Georgian families. They were flown out of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Tuesday at the request of the Soviet government and now are staying in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> until arrangements can be made for the students to finish their exchange in another city. All the American students slept through the Sunday morning conflict in the safety of their hosts' homes. <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggeshall </PERSON>, 16, said, however, she woke after hearing a woman `` wailing for hours.'' `` I remember thinking that I wished she would shut up,'' she said. The next morning, Ms. <PERSON> Coggeshall </PERSON> discovered the woman was the mother of one of the demonstrators killed. The scene was far different from the almost-festive atmosphere the young <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinians </LOCATION> had found on Wedneday, April 5, when they first arrived in this city 900 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. On Sunday, black banners hung from balconies, broken glass littered the strets along with torn official <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> flags _ red with a blue strip running across the top. A mural near the center of town reading, `` Brotherhood throughout the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>,'' was charred at the bottom from being set on fire. The streets were deserted, and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers broke up any gatherings of more than a few people. Some of the American students, fearing their parents would be worried, had gathered at one of the homes to try to call home to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They had no luck. Their teacher, <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, waited by her phone hoping to hear from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> or the <LOCATION> U.S.-U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Partnership </LOCATION>, the organization that arranged the trip. Neither, she later learned after reaching <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, could get through on the jammed telephone lines. <PERSON> Raley </PERSON>, his wife and a crew of four from <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, who were along to film the student exchange, were trapped in the Hotel <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, barricaded on both sides by tanks. None of the Americans had their passports or Soviet visas with them; the documents had been taken two days earlier to register them for a trip to the mountains. It was one of the many sightseeing trips the students never got to take because of the demonstrations. When the teen-agers first arrived, their Georgian hosts told them _ with a touch of embarrassment _ that students in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> had been protesting for three days, making travel a little difficult. Their attitude about the protests was so casual, however, that a few jokes were cracked about its being an attempt by the university students to get out of going to class. As the young Americans drove into the city, they passed thousands of Georgians jamming <LOCATION> Rustaveli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, holding hands, singing and carrying traditional, homemade <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> flags of maroon, black and white. Many of the protesters were part of a hunger strike, and they sat wrapped in blankets on the steps of the local television station. Others, crowding the narrow backstreets, had set up pup tents in church backyards. Speeches were given through bullhorns every day at the Government Palace, hub of the demonstrations. By Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> School No. 1, both near the palace, were shut down because of crowds clogging the street. On Saturday afternoon, electricity was cut off to many parts of the Georgian capital. Rumor had it that power was turned off to silence loudspeakers at a rally set for 5 p.m. Several Georgian families quietly made preparations to move the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teen-agers to the nearby mountains or in with relatives on the outskirts of town. Students, growing a bit homesick, found they could not contact <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or even <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by telephone. Their isolation did not end until they were whisked out of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Tuesday morning, passing through army barricades on the way to the airport. The students clung to their Georgian families before leaving, saying they felt safe and did not want to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We're just so worried for them,'' said <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Milling </PERSON>, 16. `` We had gotten so close to them. We do n't want to leave them behind.'' Twelve Georgian students had stayed with the American students in February in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and the exchange was supposed to last for three more weeks in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>.

 Army officials said Wednesday the arrest of four alleged leaders of the Palestinian uprising was a major blow to the 16-month-old revolt, but Palestinians said the captures would not end their struggle. Also Wednesday, police charged a Jewish settler leader, Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, with manslaughter in the death last year of an Arab shopkeeper in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. In clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded 15 Palestinians, including a 7-year-old boy, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed five casualties. At least 423 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died in the violence, which began in December 1987. The Palestinians, whose arrests were announced Tuesday, are accused of belonging to the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, an umbrella group of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem fundamentalist factions. The Unified Leadership coordinates the uprising by issuing broad strategy directives through underground leaflets. Daily activities are usually planned by local popular committees. `` It's clearly a blow to the uprising. These were organizers. These were experienced leaders at the executive level,'' Col. <PERSON> Ranaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, an army spokesman, said of the March 5 arrests. But Palestinians said the leaders would be replaced quickly. `` It is an uprising of the people, not of a few individuals,'' said <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Two of the detainees, <PERSON> Saman </PERSON> <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalalda </PERSON>, 35, were remanded into custody Wednesday by a military court. <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON> allegedly belongs to the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction. The charge sheet said he was instrumental in channeling $ 1.5 million from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> overseas to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions in the occupied lands and that he helped write two underground leaflets. <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON> denied the charges. `` I did not do any of the things I'm charged with,'' he said Wednesday <PERSON> Shalalda </PERSON> was accused of being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction. He has also pleaded innocent. The two others, journalists <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaludi </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbo </PERSON>, 28, have not been formally charged. <PERSON> Shaludi </PERSON> allegedly is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbo </PERSON> is accused of belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are the leaders of the four major terror organizations operating in the occupied territories,'' said an army official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, meanwhile, was charged with manslaughter, causing bodily harm in aggravated circumstances and intentionally damaging property. The charges stem from a Sept. 30, 1988 incident in which <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> allegedly opened fire on stone throwers in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> after they smashed his car windows. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, 54, left the car, and fired in the air from his pistol, the charges said. He then shot and killed <PERSON> Kayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 42, a shoe store owner who was standing outside his shop. One of <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>'s customers was also wounded, the charges said. The Jerusalem-born rabbi said he was not officially informed of the charges. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> is at the forefront of the Jewish settlement movement in the occupied territories. A year after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the lands in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> founded the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. About 70,000 Jews live among 1.7 million Palestinians in 130 settlements in the occupied lands.

<TEXT>
 Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces turned their howitzers on residential areas of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing 12 people in a withering attack on the eve of the civil war's 14th anniversary. The leader of the Christian army said the fighting had reduced <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to `` a cadaver in a coffin'' and urged the superpowers to help end the fighting. The shelling duel was the fiercest since the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> a week ago. It began a few minutes after a group of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> politicians left <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for more peace talks in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The barrage, which shattered an overnight lull, took civilians by surprise and forced them to rush back to bunkers and underground bomb shelters. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters, employees ran out of their offices and pedestrians ran in all directions seeking shelter. The whooshing sound of outgoing rockets and the thuds of shell explosions rocked <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. Black smoke billowed from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Corniche Mazraa commercial thoroughfare and the low-income Cola district. Fire engines raced to battle the blaze, police said. Motorists sped away after a shell slammed into the seaside boulevard near fish restaurants in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Raouche </LOCATION> district. French Ambassador <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> told reporters a shell scored a direct hit on the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Hazmiyeh </LOCATION>. `` It inflicted damage, but no casualties,'' <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> said. A Lebanese Christian security guard at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was found shot to death near the embassy compound in a suburb north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Thursday, police reported. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, 24, was shot in the head, and his body was dumped in a building entrance about a mile from the compound in <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION>, they said. Police said 12 people were killed and 38 wounded in the daylong bombardment of Moslem and Christian residential districts in the capital. In all, 192 people have been killed and 657 wounded in the most recent round of fighting, which began March 8 between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> called a news conference to renew his demand for a Syrian withdrawal. `` The Syrian occupation is as ruthless and barbarian as the Israeli occupation'' of a strip of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. Asked what has been achieved since he declared a `` war of liberation'' three weeks ago to drive the Syrians out, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been a cadaver in a coffin we were carrying for burial in a funeral procession spanning 14 years. Now the cadaver bolted straight up from the coffin to declare it's very much alive. But the Syrians unleashed their bombing wrath to finish it off anew.'' He called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to `` stop looking the other way. Otherwise you will both be haunted by the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> curse forever.'' Both sides blamed each other for starting Wednesday's artillery duel. The latest round of fighting began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government, ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Moslem militias. The militias, led by Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, responded by shelling <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port and the Christian enclave. Later, Syrian gunners joined in the shelling and supported a land blockade of the Christian heartland by Moslem troops. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war enters its 15th year Thursday, and the fighting and the divided government threaten the nation with permanent sectarian partition. The war started after Christians became alarmed at the surge in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and Moslems demanded an equal share of power with the Christians, who dominated <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. At that time Christians were in the majority but now Moslems have become the majority, making up an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million population. The Christians have refused to surrender their long-held privileges. Since 1975, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has become the battleground for regional powers such as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The civil war has degenerated into a web of overlapping conflicts between rival factions that has defied all peace efforts, including the ill-fated intervention of the U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recently said the Americans plan no new initiative in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still haunted by the deaths of more than 240 Marines killed by a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber on Oct. 23, 1983. Concern for the fate of 15 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists also contributes to the reluctance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to become involved.

<HEAD>WASHN: ethics committee.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 And thirdly, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, you'll have to _ and I know there's this interest, particularly in your area and in my state, and I think it's wider than that now in the matters that are going forward there _ but the last thing I want to do is involve myself in any way. And please believe me, there is no _ on my view, I answered the first question as frankly as I could about the John Tower matter _ but in terms of getting even or something of that nature by unfairly intervening into a process that is now being handled by the ethics committee in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, I simply would n't condone that at all, and I would condemn it. So, I want to separate out what's happening there from this package, and certainly in response to your question, from any politics of retaliation because of my view that the Tower matter was not handled the way I would like to have seen it handled. <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, if we could go the far _ if you pardon the expression, the far right, it's really their far left. -LRB- Scattered laughter. -RRB- Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the Herald-Dispatch, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. At this point in time, would you call <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> a real American <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Anybody that gets a Purple Heart and sheds his blood fighting for his country deserves to be called an American hero. And it was in that context that I made those claims, and it is that context that I will repeat them. And the last thing I want to do is intervene in that matter that is now before the courts. But that's how I feel about those who risk their lives to save this country. Seigenthaler: I ca n't tell who this is. Q. Mr. President, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record-News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In view of the fact that there's a program on the table to put a space establishment in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the super collider is going to be built in <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s backyard, or has been selected to be built in <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s backyard, and two or three of the top administrative officials are from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is there a real backlash developing because of that? We saw the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Mafia, we saw the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Mafia talked about by the press, is this going to happen and is it going to hurt your program? Bush: No. -LRB- Scattered laughter. -RRB- No, we've made appointments that are excellent in my view, men and women outstanding and the fact that some of them come from my home state, hey, what's wrong with that? And the super collider decision was made by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. It's a good decision. I want to support it. The space center was made by _ I guess, when President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was in office, or maybe under President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, I'm not sure. And it should have strong support. But I do n't see any risk of backlash at all provided that you get people that measure up, and that's what I'm trying to do.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged a ban on campaign contributions by political action committees and said he opposed federal financing of congressional races Wednesday as he unveiled proposals to tighten ethical rules for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges and the executive branch. `` We've got to work together to reform a public code of conduct that, at times, appears to be in disarray,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And it's not logical or fair _ it's both too harsh and too lenient and it elevates detail over substance, precept over principle. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his program in a speech to the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. Most of his proposals were embraced in a legislative proposal he sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or an executive order he signed during the day. Suggesting a major change in the way congressional campaigns are financed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a halt to campaign contributions from political action committees, which pumped nearly $ 156 million directly into congressional races last year. `` We have allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowed by special interests, and we can best restore the role of the parties by limiting political action committees,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` PACs weaken the parties, restrain competition and deaden the political debate,'' the president added. Aside from the $ 156 million in direct contributions, PACs spent $ 6.8 million to help specific congressional candidates, but the money went for such expenses as television commercials and mailings with nothing going directly into the candidates' campaign treasuries, according to records at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign received $ 862,950 in direct contributions from PACs last year and benefitted from million of dollars the PACs spent independently on its behalf. One PAC alone, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, spent $ 8.1 million to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> records. Stopping short of offering a formal proposal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would consult with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on PAC funds. Brushing aside a plan espoused chiefly by Democrats, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` I also oppose federal funding of congressional campaigns.'' If adopted, the net result of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recommendations would be for congressional races to be financed by private contributions, already limited by law to $ 1,000 per candidate per election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate a provision of law allowing legislators to convet leftover campaign funds to personal use, as is permitted for anyone who held office before 1980. `` Political donations should not become a sort of individual retirement account for members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said. In a question and answer session with the editors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ He has given `` a full accounting'' of his role in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret program to supply the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Referring to reports about his role, emanating from the trial of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't like reading charges that I happen to feel are untrue but I have to stand on that, and that just goes with the territory.'' He said he still considers North a hero based on his decorated service in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. _ Said the federal government had moved `` much more quickly and more boldly than it gets credit for'' in the cleanup of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil Nevertheless, he said `` maybe I should accept some criticism on whether I should have'' sent in federal troops a week earlier than he did. _ He would not commit himself to veto the Fairness Doctrine if it is reinstated by congressional action Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a renewal of the regulation last year and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I will stand with the previous position'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. _ His off-the-record social contacts with reporters were not intended `` to seduce the press We're treating them as human beings.'' Among the main points of his ethics proposals, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a 25 percent pay increase for federal judges, coupled with a ban on members of the judiciary accepting speaking fees and other honoraria. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he supported higher pay for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as a ban on honoraria for lawmakers, but would not make a specific proposal until he consulted with legislative leaders. `` There is no point, absolutely no point, in putting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed,'' he said. After a public uprising, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> killed a 51 percent pay increase for itself earlier this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and senior personnel in the judicial and congressional branches who leave the government be barred from lobbying their former colleagues for one year. Executive branch employees, already subject to such a ban, would be prohibited from contact with any executive branch agency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be covered by the same independent counsel law that has been used in authorizing investigations of alleged improprieties by members of the executive branch. The president said that `` a practice is either ethical or it is not. And if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is to be a level playing field, then every player should be treated the same.'' In his executive order, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> barred senior government officials from serving on the boards of profit-making enterprises. He proposed that the ban be extended to congressional and judicial officials as well. The executive order also would give elevated rank to a designated ethics officer in each department. Full-time presidential appointees, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employees and <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> employees also would be barred from receiving any outside earned income.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Unveils Detailed Proposal On Short-Range Missile Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unveiled a detailed proposal to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> for starting negotiations to eliminate short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in a move that could widen differences within the Western alliance. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> already has rejected previous Soviet pressure to begin talks aimed at reducing or eliminating the tactical nuclear weapons, which have a range of less than 310 miles. But a growing number of people in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a key <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country, have expressed doubt the short-range weapons are still needed because of a perceived reduction of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc threat. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact foreign ministers, ending a two-day meeting in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, issued a communique proposing `` separate negotiations in the near future on tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The communique said `` preparations for the proposed negotiations, its mandate and who should participate can be discussed in special consultations,'' which it said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries are ready to begin immediately. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear weapons are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> also said both sides should agree not to modernize their short-range nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has previously denounced <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s modernization plans, which also are opposed by a growing number of West Germans. `` The member states of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> are of the opinion that a decision not to modernize tactical atomic weapons would create a favorable atmosphere for such negotiations ...'' the communique said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he still believes the federal government should not have taken over the Alaskan oil spill cleanup effort, although he conceded it could have gotten involved earlier. Fielding questions after a speech to a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained the administration moved `` more quickly and more boldly than it gets credit for.'' But at the same time, he said, `` Maybe I should accept some criticism'' that he should have moved earlier than April 7 to step up federal involvement in the environmental disaster off the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he now believes the federal government `` is properly involved'' in that effort and said `` we should not have done what some are urging upon us _ federalizing that whole cleanup.'' Last Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> in charge of coordinating actions by federal agencies in connection with cleaning up the spill from the Exxon Valdez in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. He also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to make military troops and equipment available to assist in the effort. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that while he was pleased the federal government has stepped up its involvement in the cleanup, `` I would also like to see more volunteers involved.'' The president said he believes liability laws should be eased to that volunteer groups wo n't be kept from helping out because of fears by the government of potentially `` outrageous liability claims.'' `` We have moved forward on the cleanup,'' he said. `` The first was containment, and now it's mainly in the cleanup phase, although there still are some containment problems.'' On other matters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ He often invites reporters to private White House social events, although he is not doing it to get friendlier coverage from the White House press corps <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> extend such invitations `` not to defuse the press _ treating them as human beings.'' _ He knows of `` no retaliatory action'' taken by his administration because of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeat of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as a nominee to be secretary of defense <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if there any plans by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to retaliate against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who is under investigation by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel for alleged ethics violations. `` I think it would be impossible to do, anyway,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` and it would be wrong, and certainly I would condemn anyone in our administration that had any hand in anything of that nature.''

 <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>: Mr. President, I apologize. I neglected the far left. Some would say it was out of character with me but _ -LRB- laughter -RRB-. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Note that he said that, not I. Go ahead. Q. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ureneck </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Press-Herald. Mr. President, I live and work in a state with a 2,500 mile coast line, a coast line that includes an oil terminal as well as the village of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. I'm wondering why it took so long for the government to move on the Alaskan oil spill. Why did n't the government _ the federal government _ move more boldly, more quickly to clean up the spill? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I think the federal government moved much more quickly and more boldly than it gets credit for. I consider the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> a part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government. And the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> moved very rapidly. What we did not want to do, and I am convinced now even in retrospect that this decision is correct, was to relieve the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> of its liability by federalizing. And when I promptly sent our able <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, and our head of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, Admiral <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, the secretary of transportation up there, they came back with the unanimous recommendation that federalizing was n't appropriate. The federal assets _ we have moved forward now on the cleanup. The first was containment and now it's mainly in the cleanup phase, although there still are some containment problems. Subsequently _ and maybe I should accept some criticism on whether I should have done this a week before we did, or something of that nature, of giving you the reasons. But I think that the federal government is properly involved but should not _ we should not have done what some are urging upon us, federalize that whole cleanup. And you know, it's a tough one. I do know the corner of the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> coast you're talking about and something about the pristine nature of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. And I do have a great concern about the environment. I want to do better. I want to do better and set higher standards in the environment. But I also happen to believe that the national security needs of this country are served by having production offshore and by producing oil from the North Slope. And it is awful hard to guarantee against a contingency in a 10-mile _ where in a 10-mile-wide channel after thousands and thousands and thousands _ put it millions _ barrels have gone through there safely, and now apparently what _ human error seems to have caused this aberration. It's hard to have a contingency plan against that. And the other day they asked me about that and said, `` Well'' _ you know, because there were some saying, `` Well, you ought to shut down the oil coming out of <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, coming through _ you know, around the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>.'' And I said, `` Well, to guarantee against what happened, should we shut down all the production off of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>?'' I'm not sure I understand the difference. And I think we have got to do everything we can to learn from this. We've got to do everything we can to have a plan that is based not on a third of the spill, but on the totality of this spill in terms of _ in terms of recovery. But I simply do not want this disaster to _ this is n't on your question, but projecting a little _ to weaken the national security interests by making us further and further dependent on foreign oil. We're about up to 50 percent now, and that is not a good enough standard.

 The secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> challenged <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> nations Wednesday to begin reducing their short-range nuclear weapon strength if they are interested in talks with the West on the subject. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> made the comment after meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and advisers at the White House concerning <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy, <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations and preparations for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit May 29-30 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ministers meeting in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Tuesday called for negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on tactical short-range nuclear weapons. `` This is no news; they have repeatedly stated such intentions,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told reporters. `` I would call to your attention that they have 14 times more short-range weapons than we have,'' he said. `` It would be a good idea, if they are interested, to reduce and start to build down their short-range nuclear weapons.'' A White House statement said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> met for half an hour. It said they discussed `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit preparations, the continuing validity of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy and developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` The president emphasized the success of the alliance in keeping the peace and promoting prosperity for 40 years, and his desire that their May summit project a broad vision of the alliance's future,'' the statement said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> attended the meeting.

But first, let us come and make a success out of our proposal,'' he said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to quickly approve a $ 49.7 million bipartisan aid plan for the Contra rebels to set up an acid test of the willingness of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and its Soviet allies to support the peace process. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 32-10 to recommend the compromise plan be adopted. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations panel approved it, 18-4. The proposal, which could reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by Thursday, is likely to be approved by both chambers, putting at least a temporary end to years of controversy and divisiveness over former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy of arming the Contras. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the new arrangement to maintain the Contras with clothing, food, medical suplies and other non-military aid will `` put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> back in the ballgame in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Up to now, we have been out of the ballgame because we had the legislature going in one direction and the executive going in another direction and we could n't function,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee. `` Today, for the first time, we have an opportunity to speak with one voice to the people of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the plan will focus international attention on the Sendinistas and make clear whether or not they will keep the promises made when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the other Central American presidents signed the <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> accord in August 1987. `` Between now and February 1990, when elections are scheduled in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the whole world will know the answer to this question: Do the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> keep their word?'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said that question will be answered by whether or not the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> negotiate fair election rules, permit the return of the Contras with safety under democratic conditions and stop supporting Marxist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` Their record is abysmal; they have not kept any of their promises,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we do have an opportunity now to focus world opinion on their willingness to keep their promises.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted the Soviets have said they support the <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> agreement. `` Now we will have an opportunity to see if they really do,'' he said. `` We will see if there is any meat on the bones of ` New Thinking' as far as their goals in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are concerned.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> uses <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a `` dumping ground'' for $ 515 million in military aid a year and noted that the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms aid to the Contras expired in the spring of 1988. There was some grumbling by Republicans that the terms of the agreement permit the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to cut off the flow of aid to the Contras after seven months if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sees fit. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the agreement represents the best opportunity to forge a unified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. He said nothing in it bars the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration from seeking renewed military aid for the Contras if that seems justified by events. But Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said that for all practical purposes, the bipartisan agreement cancels the policy of using the Contras as surrogate fighters for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` I think this is a historic moment,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` I think both sides now realize that the Contra war is at an end.''

Mr. President _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ when the North trial is over, will you tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people if you were the so-called `` discreet emissary'' sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> during the Iran-Contra affair and, if you were, give a full accounting of what you did there? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I think I've given a full accounting. I would refer you, sir, to what _ incidentally, in today's paper, to what was said by Ambassador <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> and also <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON>, who sat in on that meeting And having said that, every attorney that advises the president has advised me not to do something that inadvertently would cause a mistrial or would disturb the process that is under way. And so I _ I do n't like reading charges that I happen to feel are untrue, but I have to stand on that, and that just goes with the territory. And I am confident that the process that has gone on and the process that undoubtedly will go on after this trial is over will _ will say that anything I have heretofore said is correct. But I do not want to be pushed into doing something for self-aggrandizement that would be _ would be ruled by some judge to _ to have aborted a trial that is under way. Well, thank you all very much. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>: Mr. President _ Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I _ -LRB- applause -RRB- _ Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I'm sure _ -LRB- applause -RRB- _ Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I'm sure you know that there is overwhelming support for those ethics proposals you put forward today. I would only hope _ first of all, thank you for your generous time. I hope you will treat this forum, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, as an annual place where you can come and provide us with additional proposals throughout your administration. We are in your debt. The president and his party will leave; will the members of the society please remain in their seats. -LRB- Applause. -RRB-

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Wednesday he will nominate <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rear </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, an astronaut who flew in two space shuttle missions, to head the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` This marks the first time in its distinguished history that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has been to space,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others at the White House. Truly, 50, became a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronaut in 1969 and has been the agency's associate administrator for space flight since 1986. He piloted the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s second space shuttle flight and was commander of the eighth flight in 1983. He led the recovery team after the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986, and a subsequent team in charge of redesigning the shuttle's boosters and revamping safety procedures. `` Because <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> is an active duty naval officer, I will need the assent and cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make this appointment,'' the president said. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, deputy White House press secretary, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> be a civilian. The position is subject to confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The president also announced that he plans to nominate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to succeed <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> as deputy administrator of the agency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that immediately after the ceremony, Truly was leaving for <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> to take charge of the flight readiness team for the next space shuttle flight, in which the shuttle Atlantis will carry the Magellan radar mapping device. `` The launch of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of long-planned space science missions scheduled for 1989, and I personally place a great deal of importance in our nation's civil space program,'' the president said. Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be, said, `` To have a good flight readiness and get <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> on its way to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>.'' The president thanked <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, who attended the ceremonial announcement in the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, for `` an outstanding job'' as head of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> retired from the post last month after holding it for more than two years. Also at the ceremony were Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>; Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif.; Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa.; Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>,; Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss.; and Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., among others Before his space flights, Truly was pilot for one of the two-man crews that conducted landing tests with the space shuttle Enterprise when it was hauled aloft on the back of a 747 jumbo jet. Truly holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and was commissioned an ensign in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1959.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid tribute Wednesday night to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s volunteer firefighters, saying they deserve a federal government that `` understands and values'' their place in the nation's communities. `` I was struck by the fact that 85 percent of our nation's fire protection is supplied by volunteers,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery to a <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> dinner. `` For more than 200 years, firefighters have been this nation's neighbor _ in word and deed _ the backbone of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the president said `` You have met local emergencies through volunteer and paid fire and emergency service networks. And today, you meet them still _ 3 million members strong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believes the federal government should support volunteer firefighters and noted that he supports the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> `` retaining its prominence as a national training center.'' `` Each year, more than 6,000 lives are lost in fires and over $ 10 billion lost in property damage,'' he said. `` To combat such tragedy, we must foster greater public awareness of fire problems by supporting the federal fire safety programs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that as part of that effort, the death benefit for fallen fire fighters was raised from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 in legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year.

<TEXT>
 Attorneys for impeached Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> pleaded Wednesday for up to $ 950,000 from the government to finance his fight to stay on the bench but they encountered a cool reception from senators. `` You're making an unprecedented request for compensation which, just speaking for myself, I do n't think you're going to have available,'' Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, R-Pa., told <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> The House on Aug. 3 approved 413-3 articles of impeachment accusing the 52-year-old <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge of conspiring to obtain a bribe in 1981 and lying about it in 1983 before a jury that eventually acquitted him. One impeachment article also accuses <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, of improperly disclosing secret wiretap information and as a result torpedoing a federal investigation. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> says he knew nothing of any plot. He claims it stemmed from an idle boast by a friend and one-time classmate, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>, that he could influence the judge's actions Borders, described in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee report as politically influential in the late 1970s, was convicted of conspiracy and imprisoned after accepting a garment bag stuffed with $ 125,000 in cash from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent. A 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel is preparing to hear evidence. Based on its report, the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will then vote on whether to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the bench and halt payment of his $ 89,500 salary. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he is unsure if he will call on Borders, who has `` grounds to fear that he will be murdered'' if he testifies. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he based that statement on talks with Borders' attorney and others The cast of the case is spiced with shady characters, including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> mob boss <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trafficante </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> antique dealer who kept the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informed Borders' plans in return for lenient treatment on a narcotics charge. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel for $ 200,000 in expenses as well as unspecified fees which he said at a fair rate of compensation could add up to $ 750,000. He said that, even though <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is well paid as a judge, he is indigent for purposes of the impeachment trial because his salary is not enough to pay the high costs. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said that as a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he could afford to take the summer off and work on the <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> case. But he said that without government funding, co-counsel <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would be `` committing economic suicide'' to devote full time to the trial to the neglect of her law practice. After presenting his case to the lawmakers, however, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was not overly optimistic. `` I felt an awful lot like the train is continuing to run down the track,'' he told reporters afterward. The attorney also asked for a 180-day delay in the start of hearing evidence, saying he needs time to question potential witnesses. The list includes former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> and current Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. In addition, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> asked the senators to force the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to provide him with an array of documents ranging from working papers produced by the prosecution to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigative files. The lawmakers went into closed session to deliberate following the hearing and the chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said it might have decisions to announce later in the week. Prosecutors from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> urged the senators to turn down the request for more documents. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already had provided the defense with numerous documents and offered to work with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to duplicate others. He said, however, that it was unreasonable for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to request `` every single document that we ever reviewed.'' Even if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> complied, he said, it would be of little benefit to the defense. `` He knows very well that we have no documents that exonerate the defendant,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` If we did, why on earth would we be here? We have had no desire to spend the last three years working on this matter.'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> urged the senators not to delay the start of hearing evidence and instead begin around June 1. He said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would take no position on whether to provide government money to wage <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' legal battle. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa., however, did express concern about defense plans to question Burger, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and a wide array of other witnesses if granted the delay it seeks `` We find that all of this evidence, that none of it is relevant to the facts that must be presented to this committee,'' <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A cold front brought relief Wednesday from dense smoke that had choked south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when wildfires spread through about 32,000 acres of dry sawgrass. Smoke from the brushfires, which had enveloped metropolitan <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, cleared considerably and forecasters said the haze was n't expected to return Meanwhile, increased humidity and lighter winds helped firefighters control the blazes, according to <PERSON> Seb </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. Two major fires in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were contained overnight, with only hot spots and some flare-ups being battled, officials said. In all, 27,000 acres have burned in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> and another 5,000 acres in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. There had been particular concern about one fire that appeared headed toward the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. But spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said the closest the 18,000-acre fire got was about 4.5 miles from the park boundary. On Tuesday, smoke from the fires made it difficult for some workers in downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to see <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> a few blocks away. It also forced the evacuation of nearly 750 immigrants from a detention facility that was overwhelmed by the choking haze. The detained aliens were bused back to the <ORGANIZATION> Krome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, according to <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We expected it to clear mostly overnight and it practically has,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON>, a forecaster for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had a cold front come through and wind directions changed.'' Some of the lingering smoke blew further south, producing hazy conditions and acrid air down to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. But Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bofill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> described it as a `` very, very mild situation.

<TEXT>
 Americans considering a trek across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States-Mexico </LOCATION> border should not be dissuaded by the gruesome discovery of 12 people slaughtered in satanic rituals, officials said Wednesday. `` We do not believe there is any danger to people traveling to <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>. Members of a voodoo cult of drug smugglers, arrested in at least 12 ritual slayings, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college student, said Wednesday they sacrificed their victims for demonic protection from police. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was monitoring the situation, officials said. `` We do not issue travel advisories in connection with isolated criminal acts,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokeswoman for consular affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Last year, more than 118 million people crossed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States-Mexico </LOCATION> border, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, public affairs officer for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Of those, about 4.5 million were American pedestrians crossing from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, into <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, where authorities discovered the mutilated body on Tuesday. Thousands of Americans come over for food, shopping or drinking excursions. Restaurants, bars and curio shops dot <LOCATION> Obregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> along the first mile into the city. Authorities Wednesday were quick to say the mass killing should not alarm potential tourists. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, supervisor at the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> station of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, said it could not be determined whether the killings indicate tourists are in danger. `` We always tell people to travel with caution and stay in the tourists area,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said. Residents of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> said they hope they can ward off a stigma that could be attached to their city because of the slayings. `` We are very concerned and we will tell the tourists that 99.9 percent of the people here are good and that it only takes one or two to give the others the bad name,'' said <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a shift supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Pancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant, on Wednesday. It was the second drug-related mass killing discovered near the international border in less than two weeks, officials said. Mexican authorities found the bodies of three women and six men March 29 on an abandoned ranch near <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. All nine had been tortured, mutilated and bound, officials said On April 1, the bodies of three more men killed in similar fashion were found there. Investigators said possible motives for the <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> slayings range from revenge for lost narcotics or drug money to discouraging informants to fighting between drug-smuggling factions.

 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday that Angolan rebels had committed human rights abuses but told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to back them. `` No doubt hey -LRB- abuses -RRB- are taking place. They are on both sides,'' <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanpher </PERSON>, the department's director of Southern African affairs, responded under sharp questioning by Democrats <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>. But he added that `` continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and national reconciliation inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> are essential'' to ensure an end to the country's 14-year civil war. The rebel Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has proposed talks with the Angolan government on a peace accord and power-sharing, he said, and the government also `` is coming to realize'' such a need. <PERSON> Lanpher </PERSON>'s comments came at a hearing convened by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ssubcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to debate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in the wake of the Cuban troop pullout that began earlier this year. In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted an amendment that would withhold the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping activity in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> unless all Cuban troops are withdrawn from that country according to the stipulations of a U.S.-mediated agreement signed last December. Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Republican who introduced the measure, said it would require the president to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> periodically on the progress of the withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Cuban troops. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s amendment reflects the distrust felt by many Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the intentions of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and its ally, the Angolan government. Representative <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, ranking minority member of the <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> subcommittee, accused the Angolan government of using chemical weapons against rebels. He said allegations against <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> of gross human rights abuses are part of an Angolan campaign to discredit the organization and stop the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert support begun in 1985. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid is estimated at $ 15 million to $ 40 million. Human Rights Watch, an American monitoring group, recommended to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> be stopped in light of evidence `` showing a practice of gross abuses of human rights.'' A just-released report by the organization blames both <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the Angolan government for systematic and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and charges <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> with forcible conscription of civilians, taking hundreds of foreigners hostage and using food as a starvation weapon. <PERSON> Lanpher </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have any evidence to substantiate accusations leveled in recent months by former <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> members that their families have been burned to death because they practiced witchcraft. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which monitors the covert aid to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, urged <PERSON> Lanpher </PERSON> to investigate the allegations. `` I ca n't imagine the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to subsidize a movement that burns witches at the stake,'' he said. `` We got over that several hundred years ago at <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>.''

 A supersonic Concorde jet carrying 100 Americans dropped a chunk of its tail over the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday during an attempt to set a speed record, but it landed safely and passengers were reported eager to try again. The 9-foot tail section of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane ripped off about 25 minutes after the plane left <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, for <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> 1,000 miles away. Passengers said the plane shuddered, but the craft landed in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> about an hour later. No one was injured. The plane is attempting to set speed records for each of 12 parts of a three-week journey around the world. The passengers, who included commentator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, each paid $ 39,000 for the trip, which began in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on April 1. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, an airline spokesman, said part of the rudder disintegrated while the jet was flying at 40,000 feet at about 1,500 mph _ nearly twice the speed of sound. `` It experienced a shudder while over the Tasman Sea that was thought to have been air turbulence,'' said <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>. `` But it was a normal landing; there was no emergency.'' He said the control tower told the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leney </PERSON>, that a piece of the tail was missing. `` It was n't until we got out of the plane and saw the firetrucks and all the press ... that we knew something was wrong,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> later told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` About 25 minutes after takeoff from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> there was a large thump,'' free-lance journalist <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole-Nilva </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody looked at everybody else and lunch was served. The stewardesses looked terrified. `` The pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about and that there was a piece loose on the airplane.'' Investigators began analyzing the Concorde's flight data recorder to find out why the tail section broke off. British Airways airport service manager <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boody </PERSON> said the crew noticed `` unusual vibrations'' during the flight. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, who helped organize the trip, planned to broadcast his television show `` Firing Line'' during stops in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. Other stops on the itinerary include <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Mombassa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The trip was scheduled to end April 23 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Lorraine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, which arranged the trip, refused to release the passengers' names. `` There were no celebrities that are household names,'' said company president <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiteras </PERSON>. He said all 100 passengers were `` very excited and happy with the trip,'' and that none had asked to leave the tour. Ms. <PERSON> Cole-Nilva </PERSON> said they `` ca n't wait to get back on board.'' A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified, said the trip would cover 38,343 miles. `` It's the first ever supersonic circumnavigation of the earth,'' she said. A prototype of the Anglo-French Concorde first flew 20 years ago. It has been in commercial service since 1976, but mainly on trans-Atlantic routes. An airline spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said a spare part was being sent, but it was not known if the plane could be repaired in time to make its scheduled flight Friday to <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The airline gave no details on how much of the tail needed to be replaced. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> gave its Concordes a clean bill of health two months ago after inquiries that were prompted by the discovery of tiny cracks in the roof of one plane. Similar checks were made on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concordes </ORGANIZATION>. Concordes have been involved in a number of minor incidents, but there have been no fatal accidents.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Repeals Meese Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Wednesday revoked a regulation promulgated by his predecessor that required the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to appoint independent counsels to investigate members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who had previously expressed doubt about the order issued last summer as a parting shot by outgoing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, rescinded the regulation after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed legislation to place lawmakers under the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor law. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s action returns to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ at least while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> studies the legislation _ its traditional role in investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to review the role of the independent counsel,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Until that review is completed, the previously established system for handling allegations of wrongdoing by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has worked well for many years, will be followed.'' The order was issued hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed in his ethics package to extend to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the law providing for court appointment of independent counsels to investigate high government officials. The law currently applies only to high-ranking executive branch officials, based on the presumption the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would have a conflict-of-interest when called upon to investigate allegations against administration officials. Critics of the law, which included former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials prosecuted under it, contend it should also apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, himself the target of two independent counsel investigations that yielded no charges, promulgated the regulation requiring that the attorney general appoint special prosecutors to investigate wrongdoing by member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s order means the public integrity section will have complete jurisdiction to investigate payroll padding allegations against <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the non-voting delegate from the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> noted that since the public integrity section of the criminal division was established in 1976, 20 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been convicted of federal crimes. The department is investigating allegations that <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> employed the son of Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., on his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> payroll while the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was actually living in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> It would also mean that, pending any action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, the department would have jurisdiction to investigate any allegations of wrongdoing against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the public integrity section is awaiting the results of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. It will review the panel's report to determine if a further investigation is warranted.

 Senators began amending President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan bailout plan Wednesday with an aim of finishing their changes in one day but, like their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, quickly fell into disagreement over how soon S & amp; L owners should be made to put up more of their own money to stay in business The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was expected to divide along party lines with the 12 Democrats outvoting their nine <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to reject <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to not include in the federal budget the immediate $ 50 billion taxpayer cost of the bailout. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a letter Wednesday to the panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., did not repeat his earlier threat to recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the package if the $ 50 billion bailout cost is included in the fiscal 1989 budget But, in commmending as `` on balance, meritorious,'' proposed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> changes in the new, tougher regulations and capital requirements that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would impose on the industry, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the administration still opposes <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s plan to reflect the cost of the bailout now rather than over 30 years. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the chief advocate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> of such a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving a letter Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989. If <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc on efforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and 1991. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has the sole power to make that decision but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him. <PERSON> Riege </PERSON> said his plan would avoid the `` accounting and budget gimmickry'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal by reducing the interest costs of financing the bailout through direct <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing at a savings of $ 4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, the committee's ranking Republican, said he still has a `` fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailout costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been exceeded. All three versions _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's and one being put together in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommitee _ would use the $ 50 billion over the next three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls in 1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so. They also provide for an additional $ 33 billion _ $ 300 million a year of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thrift insolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest rates continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession. `` The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we've done,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said `` We've given him a strong bill with many streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a repeat of what's happened in the past.'' Unlike changes made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's version retains <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to double by June 1991 the required capital that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L operators must have to qualify for federal deposit insurance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that standard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue growing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages and consumer loans. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, which finished its third full day of drafting the bill, rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s measure to make S & amp; Ls have the same minimum capital requirements as banks _ $ 6 for every $ 100 of outstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor _ $ 3 for every $ 100 in loans _ but requiring for the first time that half that amount be in real money. Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of what critics call `` smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.'' Those accounting practices have allowed S & amp; Ls to escape putting up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such items as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, `` good will,'' their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices. By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted to continue allowing S & amp; Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiaries to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate development, fast food franchises and junk bonds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's version would phase out such practices over five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel also approved Wednesday a measure by its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, requiring S & amp; Ls to concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages, compared with the 60 percent now required. But the measure also broadly defines housing to include consumer, education and small business loans and no <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L would be penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet the requirement. The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the full committee, which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed property from failed S & amp; Ls for housing poor people. It authorizes spending $ 574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer discounts or low-interest loans to purchasers. It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing government oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the dumping of the property at firesale prices.

 Here are major provisions of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals Wednesday to tighten ethics rules for judges, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PAY RAISES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a 25 percent pay increase for federal judges, coupled with a ban on acceptance of speaking fees and other honoraria. Associate justices of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, for example, would see their salaries rise from $ 110,000 to $ 137,000 while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district court judges' pay would go to $ 111,900 from $ 89,500. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he supported pay hikes and a honoraria ban for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but did not make a specific proposal.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAMPAIGN FINANCING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a ban on the use of leftover campaign contributions for personal use and office expenses. The law now allows anyone who held office before 1980 to use such funds for any lawful purpose. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also called for a ban on campaign contributions by political action committees, although he did not make a formal proposal on it. He also said he opposes efforts to set up a federal fund for congressional races like the taxpayer-supported one that is used for the presidential campaign.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 To tighten financial disclosure rules, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a uniform system for the three branches of government, requiring individuals to disclose the actual value of each asset and source of income, rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. Currently, individuals are required to report only within broad categories, such as $ 5,000 to $ 15,000. More members of the executive branch also would have to file disclosure reports.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed to expand a law that forbids individuals in the executive branch from taking official actions that financially benefit them or members of their family. He said it also should apply to the judiciary and employes of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, though not to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members themselves.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Senior officials in all three branches of government would be barred from serving on the board of directors of for-profit enterprises.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POST EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who retire or are defeated be barred for a year from contacting former colleagues to lobby them. This ban also would be extended to senior officials in the judicial branch. His proposed bill also would abolish `` compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of the executive branch for purposes of lobbying. That means that executive branch workers, currently barred for a year from lobbying their former office once they leave the government, would be under the same restriction regarding all the departments of the executive branch.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ENFORCEMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The independent counsel statute that has been invoked to authorize investigations of members of the executive branch would be extended to cover the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EXECUTIVE ORDER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Under an executive order issued by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, fulltime, non-career presidential appointees in the executive branch would be prohibited from receiving any earned income from outside employment. The executive order also would give elevated rank to a designated ethics officer in each department.

<HEAD>Suspected Basque Separatists Kill Civil Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three suspected Basque separatists shot and killed a paramilitary civil guard Wednesday and fled in a stolen car. Bomb experts in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, meanwhile, defused a letter bomb sent to Justice Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugica </PERSON>, ministry sources said. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks. But police said they bore the earmarks of the Basque separatist organization <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which has renewed attacks on government targets after a breakdown in peace talks with the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vizcaya </LOCATION> province civil governor's office said two men and a woman gunned down <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoz </PERSON>, 51, on a street in the northern city of <LOCATION> Guecho </LOCATION>, eight miles from <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>. He died an hour later of head wounds. The getaway car was not immediately located, but police found its owner in <LOCATION> Lejona </LOCATION>, where the assailants handcuffed him and left him tied to a tree. ETA, an acronym for homeland and liberty in the Basque language, has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mostly military and police officers, in its 21-year campaign for self-determination for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s three-province northern Basque region. The group halted its attacks in January in return for peace talks with the government. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> ended the moratorium on April 4, however, and renewed the bomb attacks. On Monday, the government called off the talks. `` We will use all means at our disposal to battle this phenomenon,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, referring to <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> sent a statement early Wednesday to the Basque daily <ORGANIZATION> Egin </ORGANIZATION> in which it claimed responsibility for five package-bombs sent since Friday to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> officials and military targets. It also took responsibility for eight bombs set off Saturday on a rail line linking the Basque region's capital, <LOCATION> Vitoria </LOCATION>, with neighboring <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>. The bombs caused heavy damage but no injuries. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to set off bombs on the Madrid-Seville and Madrid-Valencia rail lines between midnight Thursday and midnight Saturday. An ETA package-bomb exploded Monday at a military training school in the <LOCATION> Pyrenees </LOCATION> mountains of northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, seriously injuring a sergeant. Another blew up Friday in an apartment in the Basque town of <LOCATION> Irun </LOCATION>, injuring a high school gym teacher who lost part of one arm and the fingers of a hand. Authorities defused three package bombs sent to government and military officials on Monday and Tuesday.

<HEAD>Corruption Report on Car Racket Names Five Zimbabwe Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judicial commission investigating top-level corruption linked five Cabinet ministers to a black-market car racket, according to a report published Thursday. One minister quit hours earlier. The report said that of six ministers quizzed in a two-month inquiry headed by Judge <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandura </PERSON>, only Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamuyarira </PERSON> was cleared of wrongdoing. Senior Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>, a staunch ally of President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, resigned his post on Wednesday, hours before the report was made public. Two of <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s top aides, Defense Minister <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkala </PERSON> and Political Affairs Minister <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shava </PERSON>, quit the government and the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party after lying to the commission. But <PERSON> Sandura </PERSON>'s three-member commission said Higher Education Minister <PERSON> Dzingai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutumbuka </PERSON> should be prosecuted, Industry and Technology Minister <PERSON> Callistus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndlovu </PERSON> evidently lied in his testimony and doubts exist about <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>'s evidence. The commission also recommended that <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzenda </PERSON> be prosecuted. But it exonerated army commander Gen. <PERSON> Tapfumaneyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujuru </PERSON>. The commission sent its report to <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> two weeks ago after interrogating 60 witnesses. It is <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s biggest political scandal in nine years of independence. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> ordered the probe after a provincial newspaper exposed the racket in December. He promised the full report would be made public. While identifying abuses of power, position and privileges in the leadership, the inquiry also won <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> praise for ordering some of his closest aides to face the embarrassment of being quizzed under the public spotlight. <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>, 64, is a staunch ally of <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, a veteran nationalist and a founder of the government party, the nation's only legal party, in which he holds the third-highest position. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> TV gave no explanation in announcing <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>'s resignation But aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, linked it to the corruption scandal and said <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> is expected to make an announcement this week about changes in government. The probe that shook <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s youngest nation was into purchases of cars and trucks from <LOCATION> Willowvale </LOCATION> car assembly plant by ministers and their friends at low, fixed prices. High-ranking officials allegedly used their influence to jump waiting lines for vehicles and then resell them illegally on the black market for up to five times what they paid. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> has suffered a severe shortage of cars because it lacks hard currency. Would-be buyers may wait up to 10 years for a new vehicle. <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON> admitted helping 38 friends buy cars, but insisted he took no money in return. The report said `` it was difficult to believe he received no benefits at all.'' The commission disputed the testimony of four other ministers who testified they bought cars but sold them at the statutory price. Charges being considered range from price control violations and sales tax evasion, which usually involve nominal fines, to perjury, which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. The commission praised <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyarota </PERSON>, the crusading editor who spotlighted what became known as Willowgate.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed Wednesday for calm in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> but rejected the demands of local nationalists and blamed them for igniting lethal strife he said had damaged his drive for reform. `` The interests of the working people have nothing in common with attempts to sever the existing ties of friendship and cooperation among our peoples, -LRB- to -RRB- dismantle the socialist system in the republic and push it into the slough of ethnic enmity,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. They were the Soviet leader's first direct public remarks on the unrest since at least 19 people were killed Sunday in a clash between pro-independence activists and security forces. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried excerpts of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks It said his appeal was published in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the Georgian capital and the site of Sunday's clash. The summary of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks blamed `` actions by irresponsible persons'' for the loss of life, apparently exonerating soldiers and police from any official blame. In the city of 1.2 million, 900 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, strikes continued and funeral services were planned for those killed. The Georgian Communist Party chief tendered his resignation, a Soviet spokesman said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, an ethnic Georgian, met with almost 200 Georgian nationalists, human rights activists and strike organizers in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> trying to establish concord, but the Wednesday meeting ended after nearly three hours when many participants walked out, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> reported. <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> said two speakers demanded a special session of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s parliament to consider secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He identified them as <PERSON> Karlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardavelidze </PERSON> from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Shengelaya </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a group of Georgian writers and other intellectuals. `` Shevardnadze only repeated commonplaces about perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for national restructuring, <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> said. He said student strike organizers and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organizers were among many to quit the meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Filmworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> building, viewing it as `` fruitless.''. <PERSON> Zurav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhankarashvili </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> resident and member of the Georgian human rights watchdog organization <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Watch, called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s appeal `` very dry,'' and expressed doubts it would be enough to ease tensions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also made a personal appeal for calm in February 1988 after ethnic strife occurred in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. His call only momentarily stemmed bloodshed in those republics, where more than 90 people were killed last year. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> began April 4. The trouble started when protesters criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Other protesters demanded <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference from the central government and Russians in the republic's political, economic and cultural affairs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appeared to reject both breakaway demands, saying `` reshaping ethnic relations is not recarving borders and not breaking the country's national-state structure.'' Led by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top executive body, also refused Armenian demands last year to annex a mostly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. It was that issue that led to bloodshed between those republics. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the disturbances in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> had `` damaged the interests of perestroika, democratization and renewal in the country.'' Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, but residents of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> reached by telephone said the protesters were killed when soldiers charged an unarmed pro-independence crowd that massed near the Government House before dawn Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday that a girl injured in the melee had died, which he said brought the total number of civilian deaths to 19. However, the evening government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> put the death toll at 20. Earlier reports said 75 soldiers and police were hurt, but Pravda said Wednesday 91 police and soldiers were injured. No reason for the change was given. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the first funerals will be held Thursday. Tuesday was declared an official day of mourning for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s dead. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> `` asked to be relieved of his duties'' at a meeting of Georgian party leaders Tuesday night but will keep his post until the party decides his fate. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> offered to resign after widespread criticism from other Georgian leaders. He did not specify what prompted those complaints. Signs posted at <ORGANIZATION> Tbilisi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday blamed <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> for the protesters' deaths and called him a `` killer,'' residents reported.

 Four guerrillas reported on Wednesday to a checkpoint established under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to stop fierce fighting with South African-led forces. Police said other insurgents moved deeper into the territory. Nine <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> assembly points were set up Tuesday in an effort to move guerrillas who had infiltrated into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> back to neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. They had used bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> while trying to oust <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from the territory. The latest fighting broke out April 1, the first day of a year-long process to make <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independent. At <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the guerrillas on Wednesday attacked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with words, accusing it and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of hiding advance knowledge of the infiltration in a bid to justify an attack on the insurgents. `` This was a premeditated and orchestrated ambush, for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to find the pretext to jump out of the commitment'' to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan, said <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, foreign secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had advance knowledge of the infiltration through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerial reconnaissance photographs. He said the South Africans contrived the situation to persuade <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime MInister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who was visiting <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on April 1, that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had broken the cease-fire agreement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African officials had no immediate response. <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> had ordered the guerrillas into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to surrender to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and move into camps. However, no <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers were in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> at the time. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> starting April 1. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators agree the guerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay in Angolan bases at least until May 15, when they could enter the country as unarmed refugees. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I. Last December, it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. No major skirmishes have been reported in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, since the weekend. Police say 263 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed during the recent fighting. The four guerrillas arrived Wednesday at a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoint at a Lutheran church in the northern town of <LOCATION> Oniipa </LOCATION>, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer at the scene. Two had arm wounds. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel were called in and took the men to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> camp 38 miles away at <LOCATION> Oshikango </LOCATION> border. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers helped the wounded guerrillas from the truck at <LOCATION> Oshikango </LOCATION> and placed them in a tent while plans were made to send them across the border to their bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> last weekend called on his guerrillas to withdraw from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the security forces agreed to arrange assembly points and provide safe passage to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Officials in the security forces said they saw tracks of some <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas heading into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but there were no reports of guerrillas arriving at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints until the four on Wednesday. Security force members and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters have predicted that few guerrillas will report to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints because of the deployment of security forces there, the proximity of military bases, and poor communication between guerrilla commanders and their forces. Police said some guerrillas might try to cross back into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> without reporting to the checkpoints and others might hide their weapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. A police spokesman, Chief Inspector <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brune </PERSON>, said some groups of insurgents were seen Wednesday moving south away from the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> border. So far, only 1,721 of 4,650 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers have reached the territory.

 Three Pakistani <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors transported four <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> vehicle to the Angolan border Wednesday, passing through three roadblocks manned by saluting South African soldiers unaware of who the passengers were. The four were picked up by a Lutheran missionary from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Olle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ericsson </PERSON>; given medical treatment by an Australian medic, and then carried 38 miles north to <LOCATION> Oshikango </LOCATION>, where Australian engineers raised a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag Tuesday to mark one of the border points where the guerrillas could have safe passage into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan designed to lead to elections in November and to independence for this South African-ruled territory was endangered April 1, when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas had crossed the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. In a week of fighting, 263 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> men and 27 policemen and South African soldiers died. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> asked his men to return to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> put up blue and white flags at nine assembly points in the territory to attract the guerrillas. Churches were made safe havens under an agreement among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. However, no cease-fire was in effect, and South African soldiers continued to search vehicles on the road while policemen kept watch on churches. Because the U.N.-manned assembly points were set up near South African military camps, doubts arose as to whether <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas would venture near them. But about 200 churches and mission stations exist in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and they were considered the most likely places for the guerrillas to go. `` This morning you were all skeptical and said it would n't work. Now I've proved you wrong and this is just the beginning,'' a jubilant Pakistani <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observer said to journalists. The reporters gathered at the end of the journey at <LOCATION> Oshikango </LOCATION> to see the four guerrillas placed in tents and given medical aid by Australian soldiers. The Pakistani officers _ identified only as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Farooq </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Nadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeb </PERSON> and Capt. Afafizab _ indicated the guerrillas would not be questioned by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, as was suggested Wednesday by a spokesman for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s administrator-general, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>. The South Africans want to find out from the guerrillas how many are leaving. One <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla, wounded by shrapnel under his left arm, arrived at the mission station in the morning and told <ORGANIZATION> Ericsson </ORGANIZATION> he had three comrades who wanted to come in. <ORGANIZATION> Ericcson </ORGANIZATION> notified <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors at the <LOCATION> Ondangwa </LOCATION> airbase, three miles northwest, and then headed into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> in a landrover. He promised the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> photographers at the scene he would return. An hour later, he came back with two healthy <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters and one with a bullet imbedded under his left arm and scarcely able to stand. All wore civilian clothes and had ditched their weapons. Local residents gathered around to shake the fighters' hands. One, unwounded, said he was 38 years old and had lived in exile for 14 years. He said he crossed the border on March 31, and fought the next day. He said he saw one South African soldier or policeman go down in battle, but when his rifle jammed, he threw it away and left before he saw what happened to his comrades. After first aid treatment, the Pakistani observers loaded the guerrillas into a white-painted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> landrover. As they traveled the road, with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> armored personnel carriers driving past and brown-unifomred soldiers posted at sandbags across the highway, a Pakistani officer said the guerrillas were `` scared, oh yes, very scared.'' By the time they reached Oshikango, the South African soldiers at the military camp there knew who was in the vehicle, but did nothing as it drove through sand and bushes into the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> base 200 yards away. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers helped the wounded guerrillas from the truck, and placed them in a tent while plans were made to send them across the border to their bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan goes according to schedule, a few weeks from now they may come back, without weapons, to settle in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and vote in U.N.-supervised elections.

 Police have a confession but no motive for a grisly attack that killed an entire family, including the father, two toddlers, an expectant mother and her eight-month fetus, officers said Wednesday. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slawson </PERSON>, 34, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one of manslaughter in the shooting and stabbing deaths late Tuesday at the home of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. `` During questioning the suspect admitted to detectives that he killed the family members,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in a statement released earlier in the day. `` No clear-cut motive has been established. ... We do n't know why. We have no idea.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 23, was stabbed to death; his daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, 4, and son <PERSON> Glendon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 3, were each shot once, police said. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 21, died Wednesday following surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, about 10 hours after the 8-month-term fetus she was carrying died at the scene, police said. <PERSON> Slawson </PERSON>, 34, who had worked with <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> at a compost company, was being held without bond for a preliminary hearing Thursday. Police were called to the family's second-story apartment just south of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ybor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> section shortly before 10 p.m. EDT Tuesday, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Slawson </PERSON>, a stocky <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, native with a clean-shaven head, was arrested shortly after police arrived at the apartment late Tuesday. They said they picked him up about 10 blocks away and recovered a .357 - caliber Magnum pistol and a six-inch folding knife from his <PERSON> Slawson </PERSON> was living at a motel and had been visiting the couple's home earlier in the evening, according to police `` He went back later and apparently committed the murders,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. After the attack, Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, bleeding severely, managed to crawl down a staircase and to her parents house next door to summon help. Before she was taken to a hospital, Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, still conscious, told her mother that `` <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> killed her husband and children and stabbed her,'' Detective <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossi </PERSON> said in an affidavit. A description of a car seen leaving the scene was broadcast on police radio. An officer just finishing an off-duty job at a nearby food store spotted the vehicle about 45 minutes after the killings, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` The suspect was taken into custody without incident,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Slawson </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> late last year and worked on a package assembly line for three weeks in February.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unanimously approved President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 90 billion plan for bailing out the savings and loan industry after rejecting an effort by the panel's chairman to dump the $ 50 billion immediate taxpayer portion of the cost onto the 1989 federal budget. The 21-member panel voted 11-10 to establish a quasi-government corporation for issuing 30-year bonds to finance the government's share _ as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted _ instead of the on-budget alternative advocated by <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. Democratic <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> sided with all but one of the committee's nine Republicans in favoring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan over <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s. But <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> himself admitted he had lost enthusiasm for the proposal after <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> repeatedly told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats throughout Wednesday he would recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the legislation if it swelled the budget deficit. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> throughout the day, said the administration's opposition would have made the effort to solve the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis `` drag on for months.'' `` The secretary of treasury was absolutely adamant there would be a presidentia veto and we would be back to square one,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> wrote a letter to senators in which he did n't repeat the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto threat, but did say the administration opposed <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s plan Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the chief advocate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> of such a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving a letter Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989. If <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc on efforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and 1991. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has the sole power to make that decision but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him. <PERSON> Riege </PERSON> said his plan would avoid the `` accounting and budget gimmickry'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal by reducing the interest costs of financing the bailout through direct <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing at a savings of $ 4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, the committee's ranking Republican, said he still has a `` fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailout costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been exceeded. All three versions _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's and one being put together in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommitee _ would use the $ 50 billion over the next three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls in 1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so. They also provide for an additional $ 33 billion _ $ 300 million a year of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thrift insolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest rates continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession. `` The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we've done,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said `` We've given him a strong bill with many streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a repeat of what's happened in the past.'' Unlike changes made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's version retains <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to double by June 1991 the required capital that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L operators must have to qualify for federal deposit insurance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that standard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue growing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages and consumer loans. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, which finished its third full day of drafting the bill, rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s measure to make S & amp; Ls have the same minimum capital requirements as banks _ $ 6 for every $ 100 of outstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor _ $ 3 for every $ 100 in loans _ but requiring for the first time that half that amount be in real money. Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of what critics call `` smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.'' Those accounting practices have allowed S & amp; Ls to escape putting up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such items as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, `` good will,'' their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices. By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted to continue allowing S & amp; Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiaries to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate development, fast food franchises and junk bonds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's version would phase out such practices over five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel also approved Wednesday a measure by its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, requiring S & amp; Ls to concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages, compared with the 60 percent now required. But the measure also broadly defines housing to include consumer, education and small business loans and no <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L would be penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet the requirement. The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the full committee, which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed property from failed S & amp; Ls for housing poor people. It authorizes spending $ 574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer discounts or low-interest loans to purchasers. It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing government oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the dumping of the property at firesale prices.

 Members of a voodoo cult of drug smugglers, arrested in at least 12 ritual slayings, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college student, said Wednesday they sacrificed their victims to gain demonic protection from police. Police on Wednesday night suspended digging at the ranch where they found 12 mutilated bodies and said their priority was to find a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> `` godfather'' they believe led the bloody cult. `` We killed them for protection,'' <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, told reporters. He said at a news conference that he shot and killed one victim and decapitated another. Asked if he regretted the slayings, he said, `` Yes, but it's too late.'' `` Very clearly they believed the human sacrifices and the animal sacrifices put a magical shield around them that protected them from evil or harm, even up to bullets,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> pre-medical student, the victims included a <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> policeman, a Mexican federal police volunteer, and a 16-year-old, Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. At least one victim was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in the last month, and as many as three of the dead may be American, officials said. Contrary to officials' assertions Tuesday, <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs chief agent in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, just across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Matamoras </LOCATION>, said Wednesday there was no evidence of cannibalism. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, spokesman for the Mexican attorney general's office, also said he knew nothing about reports of cannibalism, although he added that victims' brains were cut out and put on a fire, mixed with blood, herbs, rooster feet, goat heads and turtles <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said cult members removed some victims' vertebrae to use them for necklaces. Suspects in Mexican custody told police of 14 human sacrifices, but no more bodies were found by Wednesday night and digging was suspended, said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. Mexican officials said five men were arrested in the case. Mexican police took four of the men to a news conference Wednesday and the four said they killed on the command of a cult `` godfather,'' identified by police as <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> national in his late 40s. Police on both sides of the border were seeking him, and police said he may have fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a female cult member. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> killed one of the victims, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, said another of the arrested men, <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and the three other men, all <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> residents, were being detained pending the filing of formal charges of murder, kidnapping, possession of weapons, and crimes against the state, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, narcotics supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> apparently introduced a sort of voodoo or black magic to the area, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. The ritual `` has overtones of a religious cult that has been exported out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> as ` Santeria,''' <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said, based on feathers and other evidence of rituals found at the ranch and the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> home of a woman also sought by police. The Mexican attorney general's office said <PERSON> Costanzo </PERSON> is believed to have fled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said investigators believe the cult had 10 members. The 12 bodies were found Tuesday in graves in a field about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials on a routine drug search. Some victims were shot in the head, and others appeared to have been slain with machetes or sledgehammers, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. Authorities said they also found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones. Cult members were importing about 1,000 pounds of marijuana a month into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student, vanished March 14 in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> while on spring break, Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, 21, lived for about 12 hours after his abduction, and was slain with a machete, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> apparently was chosen at random after the cult members `` were told to pick one <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> male that particular night,'' <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said. One of the suspects, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> was approached by several men. `` He was walking and we went up to him and said, ` Hey, you need a ride?' He said, ` Yes.' He got into the truck and after we got out to go to the restroom, he started running and then the other guys caught up to him,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Authorities said <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> was recaptured and taken to the ranch and later killed. `` I did n't kill him, but the others who killed him hit him with a machete,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said suspects confessed to removing <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s brain and spine and chopping off his legs. In some forms of witchcraft, removal of the brain signifies a sacrifice of the victim's soul. `` I think they must be possessed by the devil. That would be the only explanation for what they did,'' <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, said at a news conference. `` I will pray for them so they will realize how wrong all this is.'' `` `` Mark never had any involvement whatsoever in narcotics,'' said his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>. `` He never even tried it. He was afraid of narcotics but yet it was narcotics that killed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>. `` When people stand there next to you and try to tell you that marijuana cigarettes does n't hurt. They're wrong. Marijuana is what killed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>. These guys were marijuana smugglers,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s hometown, a yellow ribbon ceremony had been scheduled Wednesday to draw attention to <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s disappearance After Tuesday's discovery, the ceremony was designated a memorial service. It was the third drug-related mass killing discovered along the U.S.-Mexican border within three weeks. On March 29, Mexican authorities found the bodies of three women and six men, all tortured and mutilated, on an abandoned ranch near <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said those slayings were drug-related On March 27, two people from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and three from the Mexican state of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> were found bound and stabbed in a shed in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>.

 History made <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON> one of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s best-known places, first as a major seaport for the Ottoman Empire, then as the city that gave its name to the <ORGANIZATION> Rosetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, which yielded the key to ancient hieroglyphics But the Rosetta of today hardly does justice to its rich past. Few pay any attention to its history and the sardines that once gave it wealth vanished 20 years ago _ victims of the <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> High Dam 750 miles south. The town also languishes in worry about a destructive <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, which took away its beach three years ago, swallowing up summer cabins and now threatening precious agricultural land. <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON>'s history lingers in 22 Ottoman-style, three-story houses tucked among new buildings. Long neglected, the houses overlook narrow streets shared by horse-drawn carts and 1956 Chevrolets. `` This collection of Islamic antiquities from the Ottoman Empire is second only to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mallah </PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION> Al-Amasyali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, now restored and open as a museum of <LOCATION> Rosettan </LOCATION> life in the early 19th century. `` In fact, there are more old houses here than in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>.'' Founded in the ninth century, <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON> flourished and faded, then flourished again. By the 17th century it had become one of the most important ports between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Gypsum figures in a small, recently restored military museum depict <PERSON> Rosettan </PERSON> townfolk pitched bravely in hand-to-hand combat against <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>'s troops from his French Campaign in the late 18th century and against British soldiers in 1807. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s soldiers found the <LOCATION> Rosetta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stone </LOCATION> in 1799. Twenty years later <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Champollion </PERSON>, the world's first Egyptologist, solved the puzzle of ancient heiroglyphic writing through texts from the <ORGANIZATION> Rosetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, a basalt tablet now housed in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON>'s importance began to diminish after that, and by 1819 it was no longer a major port because a new canal south of <LOCATION> Rosetta </LOCATION> diverted Nile trade to <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, 40 miles to the west. <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON>, its treasures and its 80,000 people are on hardly any tourist's itinerary these days. Maybe it's because it has no presentable hotels or restaurants. Or because of the disrepair into which most of the once-elegant houses have fallen, their intricately designed wooden ceilings, marble baths and harem areas for women left dark and dusty. The Egyptian government, however, envisions a new future for <LOCATION> Rosetta </LOCATION> and it is in tourism. An anchor of the tourism plan is an odd-looking honeycomb of anvil-shaped concrete pieces going up along the coast, forming a seawall to protect the shoreline. The wall is well along now, workers are restoring many of the old houses and mosques, and plans are in place for hotels and restaurants. `` There's a lot to see in <LOCATION> Rosetta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Yehia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, a part-time museum employee. `` We have some foreigners visiting, but they're mostly architects and Islamic art experts.'' Officials say that only after completion of the seawall will they be able to build a summer resort and a modest hotel and restaurant. That might bring the tourists. Local people, however, hope the wall, in stopping sea erosion, will bring back the sardines. The <ORGANIZATION> Aswan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION> had blocked sea erosion-resisting silt far upstream in the Nile, and by the 1970s the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> was washing away 580 feet of <ORGANIZATION> Rosetta </ORGANIZATION>'s shoreline every year. The lack of silt, which contained nutrients that attracted the sardines, already had finished off the fishing industry. By 1986, at least 70 cabins and a hotel had been inundated at <LOCATION> Rosetta </LOCATION>'s beach. An alarmed national government contracted with a company owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> government </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to build the $ 31-million seawall. Part of the seawall juts into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, and experts at <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Irrigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> expect it to act as a baiting ground for sardines. `` Rosetta was famous for its cafes. They were built and spread around with the sardine wealth,'' said <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` People caught sardines during the season, then spent their money on businesses, weddings, pilgrimage and coffee houses. `` We used to have heaps of sardines, so many you would lift them with spades. Every single person in our society has been affected by the lack of sardines, from the fisherman to the truck driver to the tradesman.'' And so, <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON> is waiting for the sardines.

<HEAD>Just Another Meeting, But Impeachment Was On The Agenda</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the bland, bureaucratic shorthand of the government memorandum, it sounds routine. Just another White House meeting. And by the way, the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> chatted with his senior advisers about risking impeachment. That may sound like <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Watergate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but it was n't. It was <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, on his way to a 49-state re-election landslide. The question was whether the administration should be secretly soliciting aid for the Nicaraguan Contras from other countries after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The story has been spread on the court record at the Iran-Contra trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, with the government attesting to its accuracy. There is no evidence in that record that any of the senior officials on hand found it remarkable that a top aide to the president had told him he might be flirting with impeachment. It does not seem to have alarmed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> high command. It certainly did n't get in the way of the search for aid. Since impeachment is the ultimate political punishment, the word would seem to be one that would get any president's attention. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned rather than face an impeachment trial in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. This is not to suggest that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy on aid to the Contras bears comparison with the Watergate and cover-up scandals that drove <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> from office. But it is striking that the risk of committing an impeachable offense was cited by one of the official family, at a meeting attended by at least 10 other top administration officials _ including <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and the matter apparently was treated as ordinary business. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then vice president, is quoted in minutes of the meeting as having observed that the outside aid would be a problem only if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were to promise third countries something in exchange for their assistance to the Contras. Less than a year later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to that country was being expedited. The court document says the speeded-up aid was in exchange for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' continuing support of the Contras, but is silent on whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made that point in his meeting with the foreign leader. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to discuss those disclosures, saying any comment from him would interfere with the North trial. It was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then the White House chief of staff, later <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secretary of the treasury, now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of state, who raised the specter of impeachment. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s concern seems to have raised no alarm at the meeting on June 25, 1984, no suggestion that even coming close to impeachable conduct might not be a very good idea. The consensus was that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was wrong. So they decided to get a second legal opinion. According to the government's admission of facts at the North trial, Director of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told deputies at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in mid-July it was time to get moving on Contra aid from other countries `` since Attorney General -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had recently concluded that raising the funds in this manner would not be an impeachable offense, as had been suggested at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> meeting on June 25, 1984.'' Minutes of the June 25 meeting were read into the North trial record on March 10, when former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s warning had been discussed and disputed, and that most of those present disagreed with it. Whatever the merits of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s legal advice, the minutes indicate that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recognized the political peril of promoting aid to the Contras by other governments in the face of the congressional ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. He was quoted as saying that if word of the effort got out, `` We'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House.'' All of that happened during the `` Rose Garden'' phase of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign for a second term. The public record of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s day that June 25 shows a meeting with members of his staff, a meeting with members of his campaign advisory committee and two White House speeches At one of them, on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, the president complained about critics of his economic policies. `` Every time I hear them,'' he said, `` I remember <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> saying, ` The brain is a wonderful organ. It starts working the moment you get up in the morning and does n't stop until you get to the office.'''

<TEXT>
 For more than three years, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has been seeking to set firmer rules to keep <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> colleges and universities toeing the church line _ sometimes to their chagrin. That issue comes to a head when a delegation of their presidents _ 18 of them _ confer next week with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> about the matter. `` We're hoping to work through some of the ambiguities that need to be resolved,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. It's among 232 Catholic institutions of higher learning in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, many established by religious orders, but now mostly governed by independent boards of trustees. They insist that they uphold their <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> identities in a broad sense, but that specifying ecclesiastical restraints would cloud academic standing and integrity. `` Church officials have every right to criticize academic teaching, but to try to apply sanctions in a university is not appropriate,'' <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It would n't work.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 first circulated its `` working paper'' of suggestions for bishops to require adherence of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> colleges and universities to various church criteria. This stirred wide protests. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators said such control would undermine standards of academic freedom, jeopardize accreditation, block government aid and destroy many colleges. Both their faculties and student bodies are widely interreligious, but they maintain they carry on Catholic ideals in an ecumenical atmosphere of open inquiry into all truth. Responding to their protests, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> last November issued a revised `` working paper,'' the document that will be under consideration at the April 18-25 meeting between university presidents and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials. `` It's a much better document, with a lot of positive things about it,'' says <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's ninth largest Catholic university. However, he added in a telephone interview, `` the whole thing still needs work to define more clearly the autonomy of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> university and its academic freedom.'' To endanger those qualities `` would be absolute disaster,'' he said, adding: `` We're going to have to make the point that we've been able to maintain strong institutional Catholic identity, and at the same time do so in an atmosphere of academic and institutional autonomy. `` I think what's going to be persusasive is that we've done so well in maintaining both those dimensions. We're beginning to get the message across that we can be Catholic and also be real universities that have moved into the forefront of American intellectual life.'' Development of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> document on higher education is seen as part of the pope's policies to tighten adherence to church positions in the face of secularized cultures. The new draft provides that no university may have the word `` Catholic'' in its official title without consent of ecclesiastical authority, which is to insure <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> doctrinal teaching and observance at the university and may intervene for grave reasons to declare it `` no longer <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` In ways consistent with the different academic disciplines, teachers will be faithful to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> doctrine in their research and teaching,'' the document says. `` Those who teach theological subjects as regular teachers must have a mandate from the competent ecclesiastical authority.'' At the same time, the document often qualifies its requirements by saying they should be worked out on a consultative basis, and may vary according to regulations of the institutions and accepted academic practices. The provisions enable `` universities to dialogue with American bishops about the goals,'' said Sister <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's a more decentralized way of implementation.'' She said the first part of the document in setting the general goals of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> universities is `` something we can live with without too much trouble,'' but the second part is `` potentially more troubling.'' It lays down so-called `` norms'' for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> institutions, a word she said can be interpreted as `` laws.'' She said the educators also do n't like the document saying bishops could `` intervene'' in universities. `` The problem is sometimes a question of the words used,'' she said. `` We all agree that the purpose of a good strong <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> university is to remain <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> in purpose. `` But we've done very well over the last 200 years, and ought to be allowed to continue.'' <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, in his 1988 president's report on the `` Catholic identity of <LOCATION> Fordham </LOCATION>,'' says it `` rejects any notion that its <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> identity demands a religious test for either faculty or students.'' He says the church's influence is `` present within the university, even if the university, as an institution, is outside of the jurisdiction of canon law and ecclesiastical authority.''

The Rev. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> scholar of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, told a gathering of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> scholars that the phrase, `` insurmountable obstacle'' used to be applied to matters of faith, but added: `` We are now inclined to attach it to an array of nagging, difficult problems of social ethics and personal morality.''

 <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> knew when he took on the role of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON>, the attorney who defended a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> teen-ager accused of arranging her father's murder, that he wanted to put some of himself into the character. `` I saw some video tape of him being interviewed,'' said <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, best remembered for his `` M-A-S-H'' role as <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunnicut </PERSON>. `` I decided I was n't going to do an imitation of him. I was going to create my own character. He was very real within the script.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` A Deadly Silence'' on Sunday, as in actual events on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON> defends teen-ager <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON> on a charge that she hired a schoolmate to kill her father. She contended that she had him killed to stop his sexual abuse. `` I met the reporter who wrote the book,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` She was a terrific source of information. <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON> was a straightforward lawyer whose practice was mostly domestic but he had done some corporate work. `` The thing that interested me was that on a human level he really connected with this girl and became very committed to her welfare. The more he found about what her life had been like, the more passionate he became about her case.'' <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>'s book related <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON>'s story of her years-long entrapment in an incestuous relationship with her father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>. It probes deeper, however, to reveal a conspiracy of silence by friends and relatives. <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON> was shot to death on Feb. 5, 1986, at his home in <LOCATION> Selden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON>, then 16, was accused of paying a classmate $ 1,000 to kill him. She served 3 -LCB- months of her 6-month sentence. `` A Deadly Silence'' also stars <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haid </PERSON> as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>, a robust electrician who clung to such trappings of youth as fast cars and motorcycles; <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Struthers </PERSON> as social worker <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON> as Detective <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCready </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairfield </PERSON> as <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> directed from a screenplay by <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for executive producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>. `` Because of the circumstances'' of <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON>'s case, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said, `` some people felt she should not serve any time at all but should be put on some form of probation. She was a person who was trying to extricate herself, albeit violently, from a terrible situation. `` She hired a classmate to kill her father. Her class had discussed a story about an abused wife who had hired someone to kill her husband. She said, ` Who would do a thing like that?' and her classmate said he would.'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> has not been in a series since `` M-A-S-H'' left the air in 1983. He had been a journeyman actor before that, appearing in two other series, but it was `` M-A-S-H'' that gave him star power. He has starred in several unsuccessful pilots, however, including the 1985 movie-pilot `` Private Sessions'' in which he played a psychologist. He said he would now prefer to devote his time to movies, as he has done for the past several years. He produces feature and television movies and appears in some TV films. His production partner is <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Minoff </PERSON>. They produced the feature film `` <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> also directed the TV movie `` Run Till You Fall.'' He starred in `` Memorial Day'' and `` Choices of the Heart.'' If many of <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>'s films seem to have messages, it's no accident. He is passionately committed to causes. One is fighting pollution, and his next movie, `` The Smell of Money,'' deals with toxic waste. He co-wrote the story with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> wrote the screenplay. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> will produce and star in the movie for <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` The movie's about a man against the system,'' said <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>. `` His daughter becomes ill and dies from what he learns is toxic waste dumped into a stream by a factory. It's a one-factory town, and when he takes on the factory everyone turns on him rather than the polluter. We'll shoot it on location in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.'' Since 1984, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> has been married to actress <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabares </PERSON>, who is currently co-starring in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series `` Coach.'' `` I'd just come back from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1982 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> asked me to go to their affiliates meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> was doing ` One Day at a Time' and she was there, too.

<BYLINE>The Fine Points of Mortgage ``Points'' ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When they shop for home mortgage loans these days, most borrowers find themselves comparing not only interest rates but `` points.'' A point, simply defined, is 1 percent of the amount of a mortgage, paid by the borrower to the lender at the time a loan is made. In an era of high interest rates, banks and other financial institutions have increasingly relied on points as a way of maintaining the return they get on their lending activities without having to raise their rates to forbidding levels. For example, one <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank recently offered a one-year adjustable rate mortgage with no points at a starting interest rate of 10.25 percent. A competitor, meanwhile, was touting a one-year adjustable loan, with 2 -LCB- points, at 9.625 percent. Assuming you could qualify for either, which one should you choose? With adjustable mortgages in particular, there are other important variables to consider _ for example, caps on interest rate increases from year to year and over the life of the loan. But all other things being equal, the choice of a deal with or without points would depend on your circumstances as well as its mathematical merits. The higher-rate loan, for example, might appeal to people whose assets are stretched to the limit making a minimum down payment on a home, but who are confident their future earnings will cover higher monthly mortgage payments. Conversely, someone who is mainly worried about keeping monthly costs down might opt for paying points up front to get the lower rate. The burden of paying points historically has been lightened by a tax deduction. Borrowers simply included the amount of any points they paid in the mortgage-interest deduction on their tax returns. But with recent changes in the tax laws, the situation is no longer quite so simple. Points still qualify for a lump-sump deduction in the year you pay them if the charge was incurred as part of the purchase or improvement of your primary residence. Otherwise, they must be spread out for tax purposes over the life of the loan, as though they were interest payments made at periodic intervals. And to put them out in plain sight, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s forms now require that deductions for points paid be reported on a separate line from mortgage interest. This poses a problem for people who refinance their houses. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>'s position, supported by a recent court ruling, is that points paid on refinancing do n't qualify for a lump-sum deduction, unless the money is clearly used for home improvements. The new restrictions can also trip up unwary borrowers at the time of purchase if they do n't actually pay the points in cash. `` Unfortunately,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a tax expert at the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION>, `` many mortgage departments are not familiar enough with this rule and automatically suggest adding the points to the amount of the loan, thus killing the taxpayer's chance to qualify for current deductibility `` The solution, of course, is to pay the points from some source other than the lending bank,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> observes. `` If you do not have the money available, you can borrow from another bank, so as to satisfy the test that you have paid the points from your own funds.''

<HEAD>Technology, A Tool Not An Answer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After many years during which they sought to slim down and become more efficient, a large number of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manufacturing organizations remain far too complex and weighted by tradition That observation might come as a surprise to people who have heard of vastly reduced white-collar workforces, and the use of robots, automation, computers and other products of the so-called technological revolution. But, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, partner in <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION>, to throw technology at manufacturing has about as little chance of resolving its problems as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s attempt to attack social problems with an avalanche of dollars. `` The problem is not technology,'' says <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. `` It's that too many companies rushed into it, throwing robots at everything. But let's face it: If you automate a mess you still have a mess.'' In his view, based on experience in modernizing large manufacturing facilities, to tinker with technology ca n't possibly help. What is required, he says, is the guts to step back and ask: `` How would I reinvent this business?'' He is serious, and concerned, which is the reason for speaking out. `` We've been losing one market after another to foreign competition,'' he says, `` and it would be a lot worse if the weak dollar were n't helping us abroad.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, as well as in many public and private study groups, the `` answers'' being offered are almost always the same, that we must provide more icnentive to invest in technology. Technology is equated with competitiveness. It is n't so, says <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. `` I've seen production flows so complicated they remind you of ` The Flight of the Bumble Bee.''' Quality and lead time, he says, are undercut by excessive movement of products through the factory. Instead of changing business from the inside out, says <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, we must start with the marketplace and work back, providing added value that can not come from outdated techniques. Value, he says, is not just price _ it is quality, ease of use, availability and service, to name just some of its elements. After making the decision to add value, he says, you must look at every element from raw material sourcing through production and distribution. That is, you must think outside-in rather than the traditional inside-out. Working back from the marketplace, you must ask a basic question: `` Does this activity add value to the end-product? If the answer is no you eliminate it.'' The goal, he explains, is to create a smooth, logistical pipeline. That type of thinking at a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> resulted in a radical simplification of an entire sheet metal fabrication process. Results: Parts that once traveled 2,500 feet in the course of processing now travel only 150 feet. Lead time to produce a part was cut to two days from 52. Quality rose. Fewer inspections were needed. Inventories were cut. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> did it without a lot of robots or automated guided vehicles, said <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. He conceded that more technology was added, `` but only as a set of tools to support simplification.'' It is n't easy, he says, but it is necessary if American manufacturers are to become truly competitive. So far, he is n't convinced that they are `` If a manager wants to break with tradition, he has to link all the corporate fiefdoms that have evolved over the years,'' he states. `` The walls between these islands of confusion must be broken down. We have to get people talking with each other at the earliest stages of product development.'' In a traditional company, he continues, designers work on their own, then throw a design over the walls to engineering, manufacturing and marketing. They in turn throw it back, eating up precious development time. In contrast, at a competitive company teams of designers, engineers, and manufacturers focus on one common, overriding goal from day one _ how to get better products in half the time. `` You do n't do that by simply stepping on the gas,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> concludes. `` You rethink the business. Then you integrate all the elements. You get everyone speaking the same language and sharing the same information.'' Technology might be a part of the rethinking. But only as a tool.

 `` Finished this day and I hope it's good,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> wrote in his journal in 1938. The book he had just completed was `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' a novel that would awaken the social conscience of Americans in a way that `` Uncle <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s Cabin,'' `` The Jungle'' and few other works of fiction have. <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which published `` The Grapes of Wrath'' on April 14, 1939, is marking the 50th anniversary of the book with a commemorative edition containing an introduction by <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>. It is also publishing `` Working Days,'' journals <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> kept during the research and writing of what critics consider his greatest work. When he sat down to write his saga of the Joads, a Dust Bowl family migrating to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a new life, <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, 36, had already attained celebrity with `` Tortilla Flat,'' `` Of Mice and Men'' -LRB- which had been made into a long-running Broadway play -RRB- and four other novels. He wrote what he called his `` big book'' in a five-month marathon, scribbling a prodigious 2,000 words a day. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> scholar <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMott </PERSON>, who edited the journals for publication, notes that the manuscripts strikingly show little revision. But the author had already laid much groundwork, having studied the migrant farmers from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> _ derisively dubbed `` Okies'' _ for a series of articles that appeared in The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. He had bought an old bakery truck and equipped it with blankets, food and camping equipment and spent time in a migrant resettling camp. -LRB- Contrary to popular myth, he never made the trek from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, as did his fictional Joads. -RRB- <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> had also written a 70,000-word precursor to `` The Grapes of Wrath'' that he destroyed, saying the novel was too vicious and `` smart-alec,'' too much of a political tract. But it rid him of some of the venom he felt against the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and others he felt responsible for the workers' plight, and allowed him to write what he thought was a more rounded novel. Indeed, the question most frequently debated about `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, is whether it is art or firebrand propaganda.

 `` Sure, cried the tenant farmers, but it's our land. We were born on it, and got killed on it, and we died on it. Even if it's no good, it's still ours That's what makes it ours. ... That makes ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.''

 Immediately after its release, newspaper editorials, legislators and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant life. The book was burned in several cities, including <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s hometown, and was banned in many libraries and schools. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> defended the book in her weekly column, and in 1940 a congressional committee held hearings in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to find out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the workers recounted in the novel were accurate. The committee's findings vindicated the author Upon <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s death in 1968, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote the following about the book: `` The timorous and savagely reactionary among us were fretfully afraid that <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> had gone too far in his novel's portrayal of the desperately distressed in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Bless their hearts, they were dead right. He was out to rouse, not to soothe us into asking human beings to starve quietly and inconspiculously during those years of Depression and despair.'' <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> said he finds modern-day critics who call `` The Grapes of Wrath'' propaganda `` pretty tiresome.'' `` You can can say ` Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>' is propaganda,'' the author and radio raconteur said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>, who toured the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in 1987 when family farms were foreclosing one after another, and who witnessed the drought of 1988 played out on the six o'clock news, finds <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s words startlingly relevant today. `` It's as though we never experienced the Depression and had n't learned anything from it,'' said <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>, who planned to mark the anniversary by reading from the novel on his radio show, interspersed with selections from `` Dustbowl Ballads'' by <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> It should be noted that while critics hashed out the literary merits of the book, the public snapped it up in droves. It was the best-selling book of 1939 and one of the top 10 best-sellers in 1940. It also produced a successful movie adaptation starring <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> that won director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> an Academy Award. `` The Grapes of Wrath'' remains one of <PERSON> Viking </PERSON>'s all-time best-sellers today and has sold some 14 million copies worldwide, said <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovak </PERSON>.

 In awarding <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> cited the `` towering standard'' the author set in `` The Grapes of Wrath'' more than two decades earlier, although he had produced more than a dozen novels and plays since that work. <PERSON> DeMott </PERSON>, founder of The Steinbeck Quarterly and an English professor at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, says in the preface of `` Working Days'' that <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s legacy was `` his willingness to risk everything to write the best he could with what what gifts he had, and in doing so to reveal, unblinking, the enduring human spirit among the ruthless shapes of paradise.''

<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Change comes slowly down the two-lane highway that winds through forests, dairy farms and cattle barns into <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>. It's taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, and even now a visitor looking for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s house behind the Masonic lodge is asked, `` You talking about the white Masonic hall or the black one? `` This parish has n't changed since 1907. ... Education has been what kept it like it is,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a construction worker who has spent 37 of his 70 years fighting to give <PERSON> black </PERSON> students _ including his 14 children _ a chance. Hall filed suit in 1952 after being told that the school district did n't have money to furnish a black school. Ironically, segregation ended because the district could n't afford to keep it going. This semester is the first in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> with all black and white students under the same roof. Under a plan approved in December by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, classes were consolidated into three buildings, including one that Hall and other black residents built in the early 1950s. `` I'm not trying to take credit for anything,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` I wanted my children to get an education and that's what they got.'' <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> has one of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s poorest school districts. About 95 percent of the parish's annual $ 6.5 million budget comes from the state. Until Jan. 6, its 2,040 students, 70 percent of them black, attended seven schools. `` There is no question the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been operated in violation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said in December, adding that consolidation `` means desegregation will be accomplished.'' He said some of the schools `` are not fit for a dog house.'' Superintendent <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said all seven were substandard. <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, who is black and went to school here, plans to do away with a fifth school and is working to float a $ 7.5 million bond issue this fall to improve the remaining two. `` I enjoyed my elementary and high school career in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, but at the same time I knew that we were not being supported equally,'' he said. The point was driven home for <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> when he became superintendent three years ago and saw that white schools had equipment like washing machines and dryers for the athletic programs. The black schools did not. Back in the early 1950s, black students often sat on soft drink cases, boxes and pieces of logs to listen to a teacher who did n't have enough supplies `` or even a chair to sit down on,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said `` These schools were as bad as anything you've ever seen. I do n't know why they'd send children up here to get an education at a place like that I'd rather put them under a tree.'' In 1952, he asked the board for a new black school. Officials told him there was n't enough money, but they made a deal _ build the school yourself and the parish will furnish it. The black community pitched in their meager assets and their elbow grease to build a new school. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> returned to complete the deal _ and was told there was no money for furnishings. `` I told him right then that I'm going to take my children up there to go to school with the white folks,'' he said. `` He took him a good laugh. He and his crew had a big fun-making deal about it, I understand.'' Hall did n't laugh. He, his father, and two other black residents who still want to remain anonymous went to A.P. <PERSON> Tureaud </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` They said you're going to have some mad white folks here,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` I said I was already mad.'' Despite the warning, he said, the black residents faced `` nothing more than talk. All kinds of threats and talk.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> outlawed segregated schools in 1954, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in the courts for years. In the 1960s, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> built a modern black high school. A few blacks started going to white <ORGANIZATION> Greensburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a few whites attended classes in the black schools. `` It was all token desegregation,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Segregation hurt both black and white students, he said. `` You ca n't hold back one race without holding the other back.'' Over the years, running seven schools used up the parish's allotment of state-supported teacher salaries and resulted in duplication of basic classes As a result, few advanced classes were offered and the students suffered. `` We have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum,'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` I feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had over the years.'' Under consolidation, elementary school students eat lunch in a makeshift cafeteria set up in an old gymnasium, and some attend class in trailers. Head Start pupils still go to the cramped building that black residents built. Most opposition came from parents, <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` They have caused a problem by letting their kids see how much they oppose consolidation. I do n't think our kids generally oppose consolidation.'' In fact, students give consolidation a mixed review. `` It's going on pretty well now,'' said <PERSON> Pamecia </PERSON> <PERSON> Foskey </PERSON>, a black senior. `` It's all coming together. We're thinking of it as one school.'' `` It'll probably be better next year, but I wo n't be around to find out,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a white sophomore who is going to private school in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> next fall. `` It's gone better than everybody thought,'' said <PERSON> DeAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugler </PERSON>, a white sophomore who also plans to go to private school. `` It's too crowded right now If the facility gets better, I might come back. It's hard to tell.'' About 150 students, mostly white, have enrolled in private schools or are illegally attending public schools in other parishes, <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. He is enthusiastic about the future, especially if the bond issue passes. `` I think that the community is going to have more pride in its schools. We wo n't have that competition between schools. The competition is because we had all-white and all-black schools.'' A recent high school basketball game was an example of what <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> hopes will become the rule. `` It was obvious that these were kids that had never been brought together before. The support was like we had n't had before. It's now one-and-one. I feel good about it. It's going to be a family relationship.'' Hall, who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or five years, is n't so sure. `` It will be slow, slow. The chance for change will have to come with the new generation, not with none of the ones who are here now.''

 Deep within the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>'s aromatic piney woods is a small place where some of the nation's best-known and wealthiest men come to spend Occasionally, the locals say, the swells arrive in fancy cars driven by uniformed chauffeurs. Recent visitors included the head of a famous fashion house, a federal judge and a former congressman. Even top sports figures, such as <PERSON> LaMarr </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON>, the Cy Young Award-winning pitcher, sometimes show up. While in residence, these big shots may try their hand at Italian lawn bowling. Or they can indulge themselves on the tennis courts, play a game of racquetball or take a turn on a walking trail that winds through landscaped grounds past a lake. Afterwards, they can catch a movie on cable TV or, if they have the money, visit the commissary for a cup of cappuccino and some Haagen-Dazs Macadamia Brittle, one of several flavors. There are drawbacks. There is no swimming pool. And, since this exclusive little facility is a federal prison camp, everyone must sleep in dormitories and work eight hours a day, at a beginning pay rate of 11 cents an hour. Welcome to `` Club <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' as the <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> is sometimes called. It is one the 27 federal work camps where the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> houses its least dangerous felons. Sometimes derisively dubbed a `` country club prison,'' Eglin houses a population that's 66 percent white, 12 percent black, and 22 percent Hispanic. Higher-security federal prisons house about equal numbers of blacks and whites. Two-thirds of the <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION> inmates have never been to prison before. `` These are non-violent people from a variety of backgrounds; not all of them are big shots, by any means,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, superintendent of the 28-acre compound. `` Most of them are serving short sentences. And, since they are n't dangerous and we are located on a military base, we do n't even need to have a fence around the place.'' Asked if he was running a prison for rich white inmates, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said, `` Definitely not.'' He explained the white-black ratio by saying that blacks tend to live in more economically depressed areas where there's a greater likelihood of violent crime while whites have more opportunity for so-called white-collar criminal acts. Even without a fence, escapes are relatively rare among the 830 white-collar tax cheats, embezzlers, Medicaid-chiseling doctors, shyster lawyers, crooked politicians and low-level drug dealers who make up the camp population. `` We have about a half-dozen walkaways each year,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` But anybody who walks knows he wo n't be coming back here. He'll be going to a higher-security prison where the inmates are more violent and there's less freedom. Inmates say the camp is more hell than heaven. `` This is no country club. At a country club you get to go home when you want to,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a Californian who is serving time for bank fraud. `` The only thing this place is good for is to cause divorces and put children on the street without a father.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> called the prison a waste of taxpayers' money. `` If we're not dangerous, what are we doing here? he said. It costs the government almost $ 11,000 a year to keep each of the nearly 12,000 inmates currently incarcerated in prison camps. That's $ 132 million annually, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. `` Eleven thousand a year is a lot of money but it's still relatively cheap when you think that it costs about $ 18,000 a year to keep a man behind a fence,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a 17-year veteran of the federal penal system who came to Eglin from the maximum security prison at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. He disagrees with critics who say the prison camps are little more than white-collar gulags. `` If the idea is to deter crime, there's no deterrent like incarceration,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Some prisons have been called schools for crime, but <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eglin </PERSON> is the opposite. Contact with the educated professionals among the inmates can benefit other prisoners. Some recent big-name inmates include 81-year-old <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON>, head of the fashion empire. He served a one-year term for tax evasion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a convicted perjurer, and former congressman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, snared in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s ABSCAM sting, served time at <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION>. Inmate <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> remembers <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> as a man of immense presence. `` I was working in food services when he was here,'' recalled <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, contractor who's doing 37 months for a drug deal. `` I used to really get a kick out of serving him breakfast. I'd say, ` And how would you like your eggs today, Mr. <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON>?''' <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON> worked in the prison's tailor shop, doing alterations. While some inmates deride the camp's educational and industrial training programs, <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said he learned a great deal from a stock option course taught by an inmate who used to be a commodities broker. Inmates at other prisons who qualify for Eglin because of good behavior are on a waiting list. `` We're already doubled up here,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` There's no more room. At this time, the federal prison system is 154 percent overcrowded and will become even more so what with the new sentencing guidelines that mandate stiffer sentences and more time served.'' Faced with this expanding prison population, the government has built five new labor camps within 18 months, four of them on military bases. `` It's just much cheaper to use existing facilities than building new camps,'' <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oury </PERSON>, the associate superintendent at <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION>, added, `` Our mission here is n't to make things easy for criminals; it is to provide support for the military base. `` As a taxpayer I'd much rather see our uniformed personnel spending their time protecting the country than picking up trash. Let the prisoners pick up the trash and maintain the base; it makes good sense and saves money.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Says U.S. Onslaught Against Trade Barriers Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> should n't think it has forced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to turn tail on the issue of disruptive farm subsidies. Quite the contrary, he says, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators are holding to a hard line that calls for the elimination of trade-distorting subsidies over the long haul. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to aggressively seek elimination of trade-distorting measures,'' he said. `` The long-term component of the negotiations will indeed be an arduous exercise, but it i is long overdue.'' Some may have thought the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> won a victory of sorts when it blocked some of the wording initially offered in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal seeking the eventual `` elimination'' s an effort thatof trade-distorting subsidies. Even after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> changed the wording to seek a `` ratcheting'' down of the subsidies in future years, the 12-nation trading bloc remained unmovable. Finally, in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks the week of April 2-8, more than 100 countries reached agreement on an agricultural framework to be used in further trade negotiations in the months ahead. It calls for a `` substantial progressive reduction'' of disruptive farm subsidies. No mentionon that the committment must be consistent with existing legislation.'' The report added: `` Our assessment is that this will not require us to do anything differently from what we are now doing. For 1990, our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices.'' In other words, the report said, the short-term agreement is a political commitment to prevent worsening of policies that distort agricultural trade while long-term reform is being negotiated. Here are further observations from the Yeutter background report on the short-term agreement reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and how the accord may affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> programs: _ The operation of the sugar program, including import quotas, will not be restricted. _ No commitment was made on the operation of the acreage reduction programs that cover major crops such as wheat and feed grains. Other countries were convinced that it would be unwise to `` bind our hands'' when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and global stockpiles are low. _ Spending under the Export Enhancement Program _ EEP _ and other export programs will not be frozen. There was no specific commitment on the level of expenditure for any single program, although `` export subsidization is included as part of a broad commitment not to exceed current levels of domestic and export support and protection.'' Under EEP, targeted countries can buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at subsidized prices. The program is aimed at keeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products competitive with other countries, notably the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, which subsidize exports. _ Trade retaliation will not be prohibited under so-called Section 301 procedures. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said since the beginning of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round that `` we would not suspend our right to defend ourselves against unfair trade practices during the course of the negotiations.'' _ There is no plan to initiate Section 301 action against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of its restriction on imports of rice. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Japanese rice is a subject for the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round, and `` as long as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> continues to be cooperative in the negotiations, we will stick to that approach.''

 Ask <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> to say something funny and he'll come back with two words: `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>.'' To <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> was `` pure genius,'' and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> calls him `` the definitive artist of this century.'' Few characters in film history ever touched as many lives as <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s Tramp. `` The Little Fellow,'' as he called him, was the epitome of the fighting underdog: down but never out; hopelessly romantic despite endless disappointment; determined to retain his dignity in the face of despair and humiliation. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> moved beyond the pie-throwing and wild chases of slapstick to make audiences understand the Tramp's feelings about himself and the world around him. He was, as the film critic <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> once said, `` the first man to give the silent language a soul.'' April 16 marks the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s birth, and his centennial is being celebrated with tributes throughout the world. His admirers included kings and queens, soldiers and prisoners. Children chased him in the street. Writers and poets sought his company. From <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, crowds would swarm around him. Generations of performers looked to <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> as they sculpted their own brands of humor. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> realized the extent of <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s influence after seeing his 1931 classic, `` City Lights,'' in which the Tramp befriends a millionaire and falls in love with a blind girl. `` While watching the feature, I was getting very angry at <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> because I was noticing he was doing a lot of funny things that I'd seen other comedians in other features do,'' <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> said. `` It was only later that all those things I saw him doing were things he created, and that the other talents had copied him.'' The famous assembly-line sequence from an `` I Love Lucy'' episode in which <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> try to keep up with the chocolates is derived from a similar scene in <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s 1936 `` Modern Times,'' in which an assembly-line worker goes crazy. The silent chase scene in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Bananas'' is another Chaplin-inspired bit. The filmmaker once said in an interview that he admired the way <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> used thin plots on which to hang funny scenes. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> could take the simplest human predicament and expand it into a lifetime. A scene in the old TV series, `` The Honeymooners,'' finds <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> locked up in <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>'s freezing apartment on a rent strike. They're running out of food and must eat celery for dinner. Ed -LRB- Art <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> -RRB- pretends the celery is a full-course steak dinner, and eats with great flourish. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> did a similar bit when he devoured his boot in `` The Gold Rush.'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, who died in 1977 following a stroke, was born in <LOCATION> Lambeth </LOCATION>, a ghetto in the south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The son of music hall performers, his early years were difficult. His parents, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, were separated by 1892; his father rarely made child support payments, forcing <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and his older brother, <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, to spend time in a local orphanage. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> was close to his mother, but she was mentally unstable and drifted in and out of nursing homes. `` I do n't think he ever lost that thing about poverty,'' recalled <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a longtime friend whose book `` Remembering Charlie'' has recently been released. `` That haunts you, one day you wake up and it's all gone. That's a living nightmare. He once said to me, ` What would have happened to me if I never left <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>?''' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> showed talent as a mime and acrobat and first appeared on stage when he was 4, singing at a nearby music hall for a wildly appreciative audience of soldiers who threw money at the young performer. By 1899, he had become one of the Eight <ORGANIZATION> Lancashire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lads </ORGANIZATION>, a traveling group of dancers and comedians. In 1908, he became a comic with the celebrated <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Karno </PERSON> company, impressing and, at times, alienating peers with his single-minded devotion to his craft. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> would later punctuate a creative dispute by insisting, `` This is my work!'' On a tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> late in 1912, he was spotted by a talent agent. The following year, he signed a one-year contract for $ 150 a week with <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennett </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION>, known for slapstick movies that concluded with spectacular chases. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s first motion picture, `` Making a Living,'' was released in 1914 to generally favorable reviews, although his character bore no resemblance to the Tramp. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, wearing a top hat, monacle and droopy mustache, portrayed a slicker who tries to `` scoop'' a reporter. In his third picture, `` <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON>'s Strange Predictament,'' he unveiled the Tramp, drawing on English music hall costumes. He contrasted oversized pants and extra long shoes with a shrunken jacket and battered bowler hat, adding a tiny mustache and walking cane to give the impression of a man aspiring for status but not succeeding. `` He said the cane was the key to the whole characterization,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> recalled. `` The minute he found that cane he knew he had the character. He could attack people with it, he could act like the gentleman with it.'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> gave the Tramp a shuffling, `` splay-footed'' walk that he picked up by imitating an old man called `` Rummy'' Banks, who used to hold horses for coachmen outside a neighborhood pub. Audiences instantly responded. A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> reporter interviewed <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> and commented, `` You ca n't keep your eyes off his feet. Those big shoes are buttoned with 50 million eyes.'' <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> cartoons began appearing in newspapers. Songs came out _ `` Those <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feet </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, the Funniest of Them All'' and `` The Moon Shines Bright on <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>.'' By 1916, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> was with the <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, making a staggering annual salary of $ 670,000, and critics were starting to regard his films as more than just entertainment. An article in <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Weekly, `` The Art of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>,'' praised the star in ways comedians never were. It compared the vulgarity of his films to the works of Aristophanes and <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. In 1919, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> and <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> formed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> as a way of independently producing and financing their own films. `` Initially it was great,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Everson </PERSON>, a professor of cinema studies at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` None of these people were getting the full results of their labor.

 <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> began fleshing out his films _ mostly one-reelers _ with social commentary, relating the hardship faced by Europeans coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in `` The Immigrant,'' and stressing the bonds shared by warring soldiers in `` Shoulder Arms.'' His sentimental side emerged even more strongly in his feature films, starting in 1921 with `` The Kid,'' which depicted the Tramp's friendship with an abandoned boy, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON>. The film, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s first full-length feature, grossed $ 2 -LCB- million, made an instant star out of young <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> and gave full display to <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s dramatic range. His next feature, `` The Gold Rush,'' came out in 1925, and is regarded by <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> and many others as his finest work. Inspired by stories of the 1898 gold rush, the movie starred <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> as the Lone Prospector, and contained one of the most famous sequences in film history, `` The Dance of the Rolls.'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> invites an attractive singer and her friends to dinner on New Year's Eve and enthusiastically prepares the meal. But his company never shows up and <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> falls asleep. He dreams about entertaining the guests by sticking forks in two dinner rolls and acting out a puppet-like dance on the table. In another immortal segment, he's stranded without food in a freezing cabin and boils his own boot, consuming the dinner with considerable relish, even twirling the laces like spaghetti. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> often referred to an early love affair that would forever leave him with the desire to `` reach out for beauty,'' a yearning he employed to heartbreaking effect in `` The Gold Rush'' and `` The Circus,'' in which the Tramp falls in love with a circus girl. In vain, the Tramp would pursue beautiful, unreachable women, never more movingly than in `` City Lights,'' in which he befriends a pretty blind flower girl and convinces her that he is a man of wealth and distinction. As <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> wrote, the Tramp is eventually brought down to painful reality when he raises the money necessary for the blind girl to regain her sight: `` At the end of ` City Lights,' ... -LRB- she -RRB- sees him for the first time. She has imagined and anticipated him as princely, to say the least; and it had never seriously occurred to him that he is inadequate. She recognizes who he must be by his shy, confident, shining joy as he comes silently toward her. And he recognizes himself through the terrible changes in her face. `` The camera just exchanges a few quiet close-ups of the emotions which shift and intensify in each face. It is enough to shrivel the heart to see, and it is the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s peers praised him in similar terms. The great <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> repeatedly deferred to his `` rival'' as being in a class by himself, writing that `` nobody ever made so many people laugh as did <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> with his Little Tramp.'' Although the onset of talking films in the late'20s ruined the careers of many stars, notably <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> was reluctant to use sound, complaining that `` dialogue, to my way of thinking, always slows action, because action must wait upon words.'' `` Motion pictures need dialogue as much as <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> symphonies need lyrics,'' he once said. `` City Lights'' was <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s last silent movie. In 1936, he released `` Modern Times,'' which had some crude sound effects and made a star out of <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, the third of his four wives. Both movies were box-office hits, as was 1940's `` The Great Dictator,'' a stinging attack against <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, who bore an uncanny resemblance to the comic. In 1941, his artistic dreams played second to his personal life. He met and had a brief relationship with a young actress, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. She later accused <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> of fathering her child. Although blood tests backed up his claims that the baby was n't his, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jury said he was, causing considerable damage to his reputation and paving the way for right-wing branding of communism. With McCarthyism in full and furious throttle, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, an outspoken liberal and supporter of the wartime alliance with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, came under harsh attack. He had lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but had never become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, considering himself `` a citizen of the world.'' When he went to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the early'50s to film `` Limelight,'' his entry permit was revoked. The man who had embodied the American Dream, working his way from music hall performer to international celebrity, lived his final years in <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` I never saw him depressed,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. `` He loved <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He would say, ` After all, that's where I met <PERSON> Oona </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Oona </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, daughter of the playwright <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, was 18 when they married. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> was 54. `` She devoted her whole life to him,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. `` She knew how to handle an artist. <PERSON> Oona </PERSON> is completely reserved, self-effacing; never wanted the career, never wanted the limelight. She was in love with him her whole life. `` She always said, ` When I was young he looked after me, now that he's an old man, it's my turn to look after him.''' Their eight children carved their own fame: <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON>, the oldest, became an actress who soared to fame in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>'s 1965 epic, `` Dr. Zhivago.'' <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>'s wife in a TV miniseries about the writer. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> played one of the leads in `` King in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' when he was 9. All three children had walk-ons in `` Limelight.'' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> runs a French circus called <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cirque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imaginaire </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> is a businessman. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Salkind </PERSON>, producer of the Superman movies. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> recently appeared in a stage production of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s `` Buried Child'' in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, 25, the youngest, appeared in `` Notes From the Underground'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> also had two children from his second wife, <PERSON> Lita </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> won a Tony playing opposite <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> in `` Bells Are Ringing,'' and co-starred with Barbra Streisand in `` Funny Girl'' on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> died about 20 years ago. After `` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdoux </PERSON>'' flopped in 1947, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> never again regained his commercial appeal. `` Limelight,'' released in 1952, contained a memorable musical sequence with <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, but had only moderate success. He made just two more movies, both poorly received: `` A King in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' and `` A Countess From <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' a 1967 comedy starring <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> spent the last 10 years of his life collecting honors, composing new scores for his movies and working on a project, `` The Freak.'' It was never completed. He returned briefly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1972 to receive an `` honorary'' Oscar from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sciences. The <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> had paid tribute to him the year before, and the <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> gave him a special Golden Lion award. He received knighthood from Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in March 1975. A fan of the underdog to the end, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> expressed admiration for <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s `` Rocky,'' murmuring, `` excellent, excellent,'' as he watched the movie. `` He just took life as it came,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. `` He never spoke about death. He never spoke about old age. He felt he was still young. He never lost his sense of curiosity.''

 Few film stars were as internationally acclaimed as <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, and the anniversary of his 100th birthday will be commemorated by those who still cherish his memory and his art with events around the world. `` Charlot's Year'' has begun at the wine-growing village of <LOCATION> Corsier-Sur-Vevey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, as it prepares to honor the Little Tramp with a string of festivities. `` Charlot'' is the name French-speaking fans gave the world-famous comedian, who died on Christmas Day in 1977, after spending a quarter of a century at Corsier. Festivities will officially begin in <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> town just below hillside <PERSON> Corsier </PERSON>, on April 16, the day <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1889. Swiss President <PERSON> Jean-Pascal </PERSON> <PERSON> Delamuraz </PERSON> is scheduled to attend a ceremony naming a `` Square Chaplin,'' which already features an almost lifesize statue of the Little Tramp, his movie character with the bowler hat, mustache and walking stick. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, who was knighted by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in 1975, and his wife, <PERSON> Oona </PERSON>, often strolled along the nearby lake after buying English-language newspapers. Most people did not recognize them. <PERSON> Jean-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollros </PERSON>, a spokesman for the ceremony, said <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> is expected at the event. She starred in <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s last move in 1967, `` A Countess From <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kollros </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Oona </PERSON> is not in good health. She continues to reside at the Manoir de Ban, the 18th-century manor above Corsier that <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> purchased in 1953. After the square-naming ceremony, some 1,000 people, mostly children, are to march in a festive parade from <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION> to Corsier, where more celebrations are to take place under a huge circus tent holding 2,500 people. The tent is set up on `` Place <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>,'' a sprawling meadow between <PERSON> Corsier </PERSON>'s 18th-century chateau and the village hall. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Museum of the Moving Image will present `` The Worlds of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>,'' an exhibit of photographs, documents and artifacts in honor of `` Lambeth's Favorite Son. The National Film Theater is presenting a series of <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s major works along with movies depicting world events at the time.

<HEAD>A White Marble Tombstone Has Replaced the Wooden Cross</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 CORSIER-SUR-VEVEY, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The plain wooden cross that marked the burial site before the sensational theft of the body, was replaced long ago. Now there's a white, marble tombstone with the simple inscription: `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, 1889-1977,'' dropping the `` Sir'' to which the world-famous comedian was entitled after being knighted by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in 1975. Under a bright spring sun, the forget-me-nots and the white and rose hyacinths seemed freshly planted. Other graves in the Swiss cemetery were equally well kept, bearing names more familiar in the village where the reclusive actor never really struck roots. `` I am sure their gardner will prepare some special floral decoration for the anniversary,'' said <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Buenzod </PERSON>, a communal employee who takes care of the cemetery of <LOCATION> Corsier </LOCATION>, a wine-growing village overlooking <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> spent the last 25 years of his life. `` I saw some of his films but I saw him in person only once during these 25 years. He was a very discreet man.'' So seems his widow, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Oona </PERSON>, who still resides in the <ORGANIZATION> Chaplins </ORGANIZATION>' Manoir de Ban _ an 18th-century manor just above <LOCATION> Corsier </LOCATION> _ but who is rarely seen in the village. <PERSON> Corsier </PERSON> was preparing for weeks of festivities marking the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s birth. He was the village's most famous resident and, posthumously, put its name on front pages worldwide when two would-be extortionists snatched his body. Buenzod discovered the theft on March 2, 1978, more than two months after <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> died on Christmas Day following a stroke. The 300-pound oak-and-silver coffin with the body inside was recovered 10 weeks later, buried in a cornfield about 10 miles from here. News of the bizarre theft spread throughout the world. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> denounced it as `` typical for the atmopshere of crime in the inhuman Western world.'' But a Swiss court took a more lenient view of the two perpetrators, political refugees from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. `` I wanted to get money without harming anyone,'' testified <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardas </PERSON>, the theft's bungling Polish mastermind, who was arrested when he ran out of coins at a public phone during ransom negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Chaplins </ORGANIZATION>' family lawyer. The two also had to dig up the coffin for a second time because they had forgotten to take photographs to prove they were holding it. <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Oona </PERSON>, according to the lawyer, categorically rejected ransom demands, lowered gradually from $ 600,000 to $ 100,000, saying her husband was `` in heaven and in my heart.'' <PERSON> Wardas </PERSON> was sentenced to 4 -LCB- years in prison, but freed after three years because of good conduct.

 When <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocharian </PERSON> arrived here two months ago for treatment of injuries suffered in December's Armenian earthquake, he was a 9-year-od in a gray suit who talked about soccer and chess. Now it's blue jeans and sneakers, video games and Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, now 10, is one of 37 Armenian children to be treated at 10 American hospitals under a program sponsored by Project Hope. Four of the children, including <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, are being treated at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> lost his right eye and the fingers on his right hand when his grade school collapsed in the Dec. 7 quake, which left thousands of his countrymen dead, injured or homeless. Soviet doctors gave him a glass eye before he left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although overwhelmed with curiosity when he first arrived, he waited to ask questions until he was alone with <PERSON> Annadid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohanian </PERSON>, whose family is host to <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON>. And he kept his bandaged, maimed hand in his suit pocket. Finally, fascination with that most American of love objects, the automobile, pulled <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> out of his shell. Within days of arriving in February, he had seen Camaros, Porsches and Cadillacs. With a toy camera from the Ohanians, he shot two rolls of film, photographing the <PERSON> Ohanian </PERSON> family cars, a Corvette, two Fieros and a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, from every angle. `` When we go back,'' he told his father firmly, `` I do n't want to ride in our afto mekana,'' a nondescript Russian-made car. `` I will build my own car,'' he said, planning to work as an auto mechanic like his father. His father, <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON>, also has changed. At first quiet and reserved, he is quicker to chat with American-Armenians who visit. `` How do you do?'' he says in English to other visitors. <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON>, a stocky, 34-year-old with specks of gray in his hair, also has become more vocal about what he sees as shortcomings in the Soviet system. When the Ohanians first brought <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> to their small variety store in west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he was amazed at the number of available items. `` He asked, ` Why ca n't we have this back home?''' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohanian </PERSON> said. Recently, a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reporter called from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> answered questions with questions, smiling and winking at the other Armenians present. `` Who is going to pay for all this?'' he was asked. `` Do n't you know?'' he replied, adding, `` Not your country. Project Hope will. And my countrymen will.'' Later, <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> said he was angry because the Soviets have placed severe restrictions on what he and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> can bring back to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Project Hope has been giving the children's guardians $ 10 a day toward living expenses. <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> has spent most of the money on <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>; he has bought himself only a white jogging suit. Now, he said, he is afraid he will not be able to bring back any of the clothes or toys <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> has received as presents since arriving here. <PERSON> Ohanian </PERSON> said the Soviets have an official list of what may be brought into the country. It specifies only one of each item: one pair of pants, one shirt, one toy and so on. <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> has not yet told <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, who continues to play with the Matchbox cars and other toys he's received from well-wishers in places from <LOCATION> Northborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Last month, two of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s toes were transplanted to his right hand so he would have fingers The operation was not wholly successful and circulation problems developed, so doctors sewed <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s new fingers into a skin flap on his stomach to help with the healing. The doctors say <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> needs two more operations to build the toes into complete fingers. Naturally right-handed, the boy takes therapy to strengthen his left-handed abilities. He plays magnetized pick-up sticks, bounces basketballs and writes letters for his physical therapist, <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBerardino </PERSON>. Most days are spent at the Ohanians' store. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> answers the telephone with a bright greeting, `` Armenian Touch.'' For lunch everyday, he orders his favorite American sandwich _ corned beef on rye, hold the cheese. When he talks, English words pop into his conversation.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Winter People''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the most interesting films of 1988 stemmed from novels: `` Dangerous Liaisons,'' `` The Accidental Tourist,'' `` Little Dorrit,'' `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' `` Pelle the Conqueror.'' While original screenplays remain the most prevalent source of films, it is heartening to see the comeback of novels. Why so? Because from `` The Birth of a Nation'' to `` Gone With the Wind'' to `` Terms of Endearment,'' novels have lent film entertainment a substance that is often lacking on a diet of scripts originated by screenwriters and homogenized by countless rewrites. `` Winter People'' is the latest evidence. Adapted by <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobieski </PERSON> from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehle </PERSON>'s novel, the film has faults and excesses. But it also offers a certain majesty and an accurate sense of time and place _ the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the Depression 1930s. <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> -RRB- is a watchmaker who is driving his motherless daughter -LRB- <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> -RRB- to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to start a new life. When their pickup truck is wrecked in a mountain stream, they take refuge with a mysterious woman -LRB- <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> -RRB-, who lives in a remote cabin with her fatherless baby boy. The mystery unravels. <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> has been ostracized by her family, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION>, who are the leading citizens of a nearby village. The father of her child is the unruly son -LRB- <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> -RRB- of the lawless <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> clan, longtime enemies of the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> wins the young mother's confidence and love, and the respect of her family _ after proving his manhood on a bear hunt. When the father of <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>' son dies mysteriously, the long-smoldering feud between the Wrights and the <ORGANIZATION> Campbells </ORGANIZATION> erupts in violence. Director <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotcheff </PERSON> manages to keep the complicated plot running smoothly, though at times the mountain dialect is hard to comprehend. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> gives understated strength to her role, and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> has his strongest characterization to date, though the transition from milquetoast to macho man is less than smooth. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> are powerful as patriarchs of the two families. As the violent <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> is terrifying. The mountain scenery have been stunningly photographed by <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Protat </PERSON>. `` Winter People'' was produced by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solo </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. Scariness and sexual tension give it a PG-13 rating. Running time: 115 minutes.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered C.H. Butcher Jr. and others to pay $ 19.3 million in damages for a plot to hide the bankrupt financier's wealth when his banking empire collapsed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> awarded the damages Tuesday to bankruptcy trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to pay creditors in the last major civil lawsuit against Butcher. A federal jury in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> last month found that C.H. Butcher Sr. and two disbarred <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> lawyers conspired to help the younger Butcher keep some of his wealth. The jury found the senior Butcher, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwind </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> guilty under the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act following a four-day trial. C.H. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his brother, 1978 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Democratic gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, were convicted in connection with the 1983 failure of their twin banking empires, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> chain. Testimony included assertions that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> received $ 1.6 million from Butcher Jr. to buy gold bars and coins after the financier had declared bankruptcy. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has been trying to locate the $ 1.6 million and documents produced at the trial showed that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was the last person known to have handled it. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was not present at the trial. He and <PERSON> Schwind </PERSON>, his former law partner, were disbarred after their money-laundering convictions in an unrelated case. The jury awarded damages of $ 245,437 from Butcher Sr., $ 474,288 from <PERSON> Schwind </PERSON> and $ 1.63 million from <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Under a RICO provision tripling that amount, the total jury award was $ 7,049,176. But <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> found that <PERSON> Schwind </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> were liable for $ 4,889,999 after the damages were tripled, while Butcher Jr. was responsible for $ 11,276,250 individually and $ 2,422,583 with his wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>. The suit initially sought $ 126 million in damages from a dozen defendants. But after a series of out-of-court settlements, it changed the damages sought to $ 8 million from five defendants.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> intends to become a major player in basic cable television programming, says the media giant's chairman, who also took a few jabs at broadcasters who have tried to belittle the medium In a speech Tuesday to cable executives and advertisers, Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> also defended Time's planned $ 15 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> against criticism from those he called the `` lords of leverage'' and domestic rivals that he said were suffering `` merger envy.'' The deal is subject to review by federal regulators and approval by the shareholders of both companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recently announced it will not oppose the merger. Time is only indirectly involved in basic cable programming _ those channels cable subscribers automatically receive _ through investments in companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and other basic cable services. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary owns two premium cable TV services, <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>, for which cable subscribers pay an additional fee over their monthly charge. There have been published reports that <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> is considering launching a comedy cable network. While <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> did not specifically address those reports in his talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Cabletelevsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference, he said, `` Our goal in basic -LRB- cable -RRB- is to develop a high-quality, well-defined, differentiated service with the audience appeal of <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and the channel identification of <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>.'' He noted that some critics have described the basic cable audience as `` underpaid, overaged, out of touch.'' But <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said cable has changed television from a passive medium with three main viewing choices into a responsive medium `` able to appeal to a far broader range of tastes and interests than before.'' He said some broadcasting executives have responded by refusing to acknowledge the changes that have occurred in viewing habits. Time recognizes the networks' dilemma, <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said, because it faced the same situation in magazines in the late 1970s, when regional and specialized magazines began attracting bigger increases in ad spending than Time's mass market magazines were seeing. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said Time faced up to market realities and built itself into the nation's largest regional publisher. `` I do n't want to sound like I'm making a blanket attack on broadcast. I'm not,'' he said. He said there are a lot of `` smart people at the networks'' who know the value and potential of cable and are trying to get in on it. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, launches a business network on basic cable next week. Regarding the merger plan with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> repeated the dealmakers' assertions that the pact would guarantee an American company will be among the few global giants expected to dominate the communications business by the mid-1990s. He said some of Time's and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic competitors do n't like the deal <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> called it a `` chronic case of merger envy.'' `` My advice to them is to save their energy to invest in finding the kind of match that will help keep them competitive in global markets,'' he said. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> also chided `` the lords of leverage,'' who he said `` hate the deal because it builds a new company instead of breaking up two existing ones.'' `` To put it politely, I think their expressed concern that shareholders are being shortchanged by this deal resembles nothing so much as the cat worrying about the good health of the canary,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> under which <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will receive up to $ 3.65 billion over three years to help reduce payments on its $ 107 billion debt, the treasury secretary announced Tuesday. The goal is to reduce the net outflow of funds to provide the investment money needed to spur growth and reduce the debt. Significantly, the accord stipulates that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> supports <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s current economic austerity and modernization programs and requires no additional austerity measures, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said. That means that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will not require any further devaluations of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> peso, as has been called for in previous agreements in an effort to stimulate exports, an official said on condition of anonymity. `` The agreement reached with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> constitutes a plain endorsement of the economic strategy of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said. `` The fund has completely subscribed to this strategy.'' The treasury chief also announced <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will conclude `` in the next several days'' an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.5 billion in credits to support the government's restructuring programs. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> agreement will promote <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to reach restructuring agreements with creditor government banks. Tuesday's accord may be extended for a fourth year at <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s request On April 19, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will formally present to creditor banks its proposals to reduce the foreign debt's value, cut servicing and obtain additional lending over several years, <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said. The loan amount is $ 2.79 billion in Special Drawing Rights, a denomination used by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and also known as `` paper gold.'' SDRs are a measure of a nation's reserve assets in the international monetary system, and their value is based on an amalgam of major currencies. The value in this case is $ 1.30 for every dollar in the reserve assets, making the total loan worth about $ 3.6 billion. Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who took office Dec. 1, has pressed efforts to cut the outflow of capital needed to revitalize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s stagnant economy. Economic growth was nil last year. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has sought to reduce foreign debt servicing, which will cost about $ 16 billion this year, and to obtain $ 7 billion through lower payments and new loans each year for the next six years.

 <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is putting its money where its mouth is by offering customers a refund if they do n't think they've tasted the best hamburger in the business. The promise is part of a six-week advertising campaign in which <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s, one of the nation's largest fast-food chains, proclaims itself the winner in a taste contest with industry leader <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The ad campaign started Monday and ends in mid-May. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>, executive vice president of marketing, said the suburban Dublin-based company favors the taste-test over a campaign emphasizing discounts. `` The problem I have with discounts is that if you lower the price, then it must have only been worth that much in the first place,'' <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. `` We've got a product that we have a lot of confidence in its worth and its value to the consumer. Nobody's done this before.'' The money-back guarantee is in addition to the company's policy of refunding money to dissatisfied customers. Under the special offer, the company will refund the price of the hamburger to customers who do not agree that the one they just ate was the best in the burger business. <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> said the company did not estimate how much the special refunds would cost the company. `` We do n't think we're going to lose any more than we would on a legitimate complaint of a product that does n't meet our standards,'' he said. Industry analyst <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New-York </ORGANIZATION> based marketing research company <ORGANIZATION> Malcolm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knapp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> called the promotion `` a great proposition.'' He said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s came out No. 1 in a taste test this year in Restaurant and Institutions magazine. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said the strategy will cost the company less money than such promotions as couponing or discounts. `` Couponing always gives away products, for sure. And if you do discounting, you're giving away money,'' he said. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> also said the campaign will bring more people into <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s restaurants <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s is virtually tied for third with <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in size among national fast-food chains. Burger King, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is second. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said the refund strategy was tested in eight markets last year. `` It was never a problem,'' he said. He said customers trying to abuse the offer likely will be discovered because patrons tend to return to the same restaurant. He also said only a few people would try to get refunds by going to several restaurants. `` Is it worth it to do that for $ 1.39? I do n't think so,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. The advertising campaign includes a claim of taste superiority over <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s contends customers surveyed at random in 1987 and 1988 preferred <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s hamburgers by a 2-1 ratio over those offered by <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> said the company hired <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. Research of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to conduct the surveys. About 1,500 consumers were interviewed quarterly. McDonald's spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Onoda </PERSON> was not available for comment Tuesday and did not return a call seeking comment. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s, with about 3,750 restaurants nationwide, has annual sales of nearly $ 3 billion. It earned $ 28.5 million last year, continuing to rebound from 1986, when it lost $ 4.9 million. The company made $ 4.5 million in 1987.

 The status of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s deal to buy strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> remained in doubt when a Tuesday midnight deadline passed without a final agreement. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Tuesday evening. At 9:15 p.m., the meeting broke up and the two hastily walked out of the courthouse. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said he did not know what would happen next. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions remained until 11:30 p.m., when Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> told them to return to his chambers for a conference at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s agreement to buy Eastern from <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> expired at 12:01 a.m. under an agreement between the two sides. Asked about the midnight deadline, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said: `` It's not my deadline. There was an earlier deadline for certain things that I said, and it was met.'' He declined further comment. The Machinist union members, pilots and flight attendants reached five-year contracts with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> on Monday. But the the agreements are contingent on a trustee operating the airline until it comes out of bankruptcy, the negotiators said. Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9, five days after the strike by Machinist union members began. The pilots and flight attendants honored the Machinist picket lines, crippling the airline. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, head of the Eastern pilots, said the unions' would not go back to work with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in interim control `` They're not going to do it for the guy they hate the most,'' he said. `` They'll do it for <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. If he's there, we're there.'' Several lawyers involved said they expected that if a trustee is named, it would be former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who was present for the meeting on Monday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to identify his role then and was not present Tuesday. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, according to several sources, refused to go along with appointing a trustee, throwing the whole deal into doubt. `` They went ballistic,'' a source said Tuesday, describing <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s lawyers' reaction. By the end of the night, no one was knew what would happen next. `` I do n't think any one person has the whole picture,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>, a lawyer for the pilots. The day began with the parties meeting at a <LOCATION> Manahattan </LOCATION> hotel and as the day wore on, the lawyers and principals return to court, the site of Monday's talks. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, arrived in late afternoon, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in the early evening. Dozen of lawyers filled the marble hallways of the turn-of-the-century courthouse as a series of meeting again unfolded. Tension built and at several times shouting could be overheard in the halls. The climactic meeting ended at 9:15 p.m. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> were together in a room across from <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s chambers. When they emerged, they put on their coats to leave but <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> summoned them. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> entered the judge's chambers but <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> did not, and when an aide of the judge asked <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> to join, the former baseball commissioner said `` I'm not going in,'' and waved his hand through the air in resignation. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and his lawyers then walked out. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> held a private discussion with <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> and their lawyers, and then <PERSON> Ueberrroth </PERSON>'s side walked out. `` I'm not optimistic,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said in an elevator as he left. The participants described the meetings as a four-way game between <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, Lorzeno, the unions and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors. For the deal to work, all four sides had to be in agreement. `` Unless you have all of these constituencies, you do n't have a plan,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boies </PERSON>, an Eastern lawyer. Under their five-year deals with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, the three <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions get 30 percent ownership of the airline in exchange for about $ 210 million in concessions. But the creditors committee is concerned with the deal. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, an lawyer for the committee representing the unsecured creditors, said the group wanted its financial advisers to review it. `` We have some very serious reservations ... no one has made an effort to make a showing that Eastern will be viable after this transaction is consummated,'' <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> said. One condition of the proposed buyout that has raised concern is the transfer of $ 79 million in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, `` without equivalent value to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>,'' the committee said in a resoltuion passed Tuesday and given to the parties. The committee also said it was concerned whether there was an economically viable business plan for the reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and over the financial structure of the buyout, in which <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> would receive $ 200 million for its <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would incur $ 100 million in new debt. <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> said the creditors had not received a response from <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> to their statement. When asked whether the creditors were open to renegotiating the tentative agreement between <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` Anything can be renegotiated.'' Meanwhile, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said late Tuesday he would make public his opinion Wednesday at 8 ` 55 a.m. EST whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots are striking illegally. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last month asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to issue an opinion on whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots walked off the job in support of striking Machinists or whether the pilots were actually striking to further their own contract aims. If <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> finds the pilots in violation of the Railway Labor Act, the appeals court could order the pilots back to work. Such a ruling could have a major influence on whether <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> agrees to sell Eastern. Also, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON>, a former president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has been hired as a consultant by <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, said a participant in the discussions The source said <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> may play a major role in running Eastern should <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> succeed with his bid. Under <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s agreement with the unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union would give up about $ 150 million in wage and benefit cuts, a union source said Tuesday. The figures are smaller for other unions because after <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> bought Eastern three years ago, the pilots and flight attendants accepted pay cuts but the Machinists did not.

<HEAD>SmithKline, Beecham Agree To Merger</HEAD>

 The directors of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and London-based <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to merge into one of the world's largest drug and health-care-products companies, according to a published report. A formal announcement of the deal is expected Wednesday morning, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday editions, quoting unidentified sources familiar with the negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> would not comment on the report early Wednesday morning. Directors of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the merger Tuesday night, after <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s directors had approved it earlier in the day, the newspaper said. The merger is subject to approval by shareholders and government regulators. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> have been discussing a merger for months, but did not disclose the talks publicly until April 2. In a joint statement then, the companies said that if they agreed on a merger, the new company would be governed by directors drawn equally from the boards of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> and would be run by managers from both firms. The agreement stipulates that Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> would oversee three of the new company's five operating businesses: pharmaceuticals, clinical laboratories and animal-health care, said a source quoted by the Inquirer on condition of anonymity. The pharmaceutical business would be the new company's largest operation. It would be run by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s drug division, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> would run the new company's two other operations: over-the-counter medications and personal-care products. The combined company's chief executive officer would be <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, an American who is <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s executive chairman. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, will be an `` active'' chairman of the board of the merged company, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, 55, has been <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer since 1982 and its chairman since 1987. Sources estimated annual revenues of the new business at slightly less than $ 7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> reported total sales last year of $ 4.75 billion, while <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s sales exceed $ 4 billion a year. The merger agreement calls for <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> to spin off its eye-and skin-care business, <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and its 84 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by distributing the shares to stockholders. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> last fall sold to the public 16 percent of the common stock of <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> also will divest itself of several businesses not related to drugs, including cosmetics and fragrances, a source said. A source said <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> stockholders would receive shares in the new combined company in a distribution that would not result in a taxable gain for shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s stock dropped 37 -LCB- cents a share Tuesday in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, closing at $ 64.75. The stock traded as high as $ 68.50 last week. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> stock, traded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as American depositary receipts, rose 25 cents to $ 20.37 -LCB- a share Tuesday. The merger would strengthen <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s reputation and distribution in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ two vital markets where <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> is strong. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> would gain from <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s expertise in marketing over-the-counter drugs and from several promising prescription drugs in <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s research-and-development pipeline

<HEAD>Bill Introduced To SImplify Corporate Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has introduced a bill to simplify the corporate minimum tax Committee aides said no estimate of how the bill would affect tax collections has been produced, nor is it clear which industries, if any, would be hurt by the change. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said Tuesday he is open to suggestons for changes in the bill. However, he added, `` I will oppose any attempt to extend the arbitrary book-income preference beyond its scheduled expiration at the end of this year.'' The corporate minimum tax is designed to ensure that any firm with a profit pays some tax, no matter how many deductions are claimed. A company calculates is liability under the regular corporate tax, figures the minimum tax and pays the larger figure. The 1986 tax overhaul amended the minimum levy to base the tax in 1987 through 1989 on the concept of book income, a term normally used in reporting profits to stockholders but not to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. For years starting in 1990, the law drops the book-income concept and substitutes one known as `` adjusted current earnings.'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s bill would eliminate adusted current earnings as a separate tax preference. Instead, individual items of earnings would be treated as separate preferences, eliminating one complicated set of calculations.

 Six people have been indicted on 40 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, bank fraud and other charges in connection with the failure of an <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> savings and loan institution. The indictment, announced Tuesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, charged that the chief defendant, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinzie </PERSON>, 39, engineered a scheme that diverted more than $ 16 million from <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>. The alleged fraud cost taxpayers $ 120 million, which <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spent to cover insured deposits. The government alleged that Ms. <PERSON> McKinzie </PERSON>, along with her boss, the late <PERSON> Duayne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, devised the massive fraud, which involved creating phony escrow accounts as well as false billings for construction expenses. Others charged in the indictment were members of construction firms who cooperated in the scheme, as well as officers of related corporations and a man from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> who allegedly participated in the phony escrow scheme. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieben </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, who is prosecuting the case, said <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> was a former dentist who had no prior experience in finance when he launched <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan in 1983. The thrift was in trouble almost from the outset, she said. It became the subject of a federal investigation in early 1987. On Jan. 16, 1987, the day that federal regulators were due to arrive and examine the S & amp; L's books, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, 57, died in a traffic accident. His Jaguar plowed into a stone wall on a freeway near <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> noted that a $ 10 million life insurance policy had been taken out on <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, with <PERSON> McKinzie </PERSON> named as the beneficiary. Ms. <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> said that a lengthy investigation by the insurer found no evidence of suicide, and the $ 10 million was paid into an account established to cover some federal losses if Ms. <PERSON> McKinzie </PERSON> is convicted. Others charged in the indictment were: <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, Ark.; <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngdahl </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, 63, of Vista.

<HEAD>Attorneys Defend Settlement in WPPSS Default Case as Best Possible
Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 750 million settlement in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> default case was the best deal that could be struck, attorneys for a group of bondholders said. That appraisal was made Tuesday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> at a hearing on how to distribute money from settlements reached late last year in the $ 2.25 billion <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> litigation. Representatives of a separate class-action suit for some bondholders argued that no settlement should be approved until <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> decides individual bondholders' and attorneys' shares in the settlement. They also said the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should bear more responsibility for its role in the biggest municipal bond default in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After listening to about two dozen attorneys and other parties in the case, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said he would try to issue a written decision promptly. Defendants in the case, which combined dozens of suits filed since February 1983, included <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, all 88 utilities that contracted with the consortium to build two reactors, engineering firms, Wall Street bond underwriters, utility and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> directors and <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION>, an advisory firm. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on bonds it sold to finance construction of a nuclear power plant at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation and another at <LOCATION> Satsop </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. The default was triggered by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that the participating utilities lacked the legal power to sign contracts with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> guaranteeing payment even if no electricity was generated. That ruling left bondholders no option but a fraud suit, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, one of the attorneys for bondholders, told <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>. <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, another plaintiffs' attorney, said any fraud case is difficult enough to prove to a jury, let alone one with the dozens of contending parties. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said he and other attorneys for bondholders felt the most they could achieve if they won the case was a $ 1.4 billion settlement. The $ 750 million settlement was much more likely, `` and it could well be much less,'' he added. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> estimated a settlement now, rather than after years of litigation would add about $ 250 million to the value received. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON>, attorney for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, one of the defendants, said he believed defendants stood an excellent chance of winning at trial. He said that before the series of settlements were struck, there was absolutely no movement toward agreement and `` these were the maximum dollars that could have been gotten out of anyone.'' Camden Hall, an attorney for <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which at $ 50 million would pay the largest amount of any defendant, also said he felt there had been an excellent chance of winning, possibly through summary judgment. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said city officials wanted to settle to avoid millions of dollars in future legal expenses and escape the shadow cast by the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> default over future bond issues. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> could afford to settle because the city had insurance, unlike many defendants, especially tiny public utility districts which had no money to pay for an adverse ruling. <PERSON> Bondholder </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffer </PERSON> has led a class-action suit against the state on behalf of bondholders who believed the state would get off too cheaply. The state agreed to add $ 10 million to the settlement in return for an end to liability. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, an adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, argued that nearly all of the 600 bondholders who responded to a questionnaire he sent were opposed to settlements with the state, <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> and were willing to pursue court action to get a better deal. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> many bondholders referred to the questionnaire in their letters, some apparently believing <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> could do something to change the settlement so they would get the full face value. `` It is not fair'' to leave that impression and `` let them think that the -LRB- court -RRB- system has somehow let them down,'' the judge said. <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> was n't named in the original suit but agreed to pay $ 35 million to get <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the bondholders' trustee, and bondholders to abandon efforts to petition <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow a suit against the federal power-marketing agency. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> paid no money in its settlement in exchange for cooperation from its employees at the trial. Plaintiffs' attorneys said there was n't enough money left in <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> to pursue. Of five reactors being built by <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1970s, only one was completed.

<HEAD>Company That Helped Start Workstation Trend To Unveil Revamped Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the upstart company that helped launch the desktop computer industry trend toward high-powered workstations, was unveiling an entire overhaul of its product line today. Some of the new machines, priced from $ 5,995 to $ 73,900, boast sophisticated new graphics and digital sound technologies, higher speeds and a circuit board that allows full-motion video on a computer screen. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>'s president, said in a prepared statement the revamped line is another step toward bringing more powerful desktop computers into everyday business and personal use. `` Tomorrow, people will be talking to, gesturing at, and even arguing with these machines,'' he predicted, saying his new products reflect `` ease-of-use features found, before now, only in personal computers.'' Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater speed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics capabilities. The star of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>'s new product line is the SPARCstation 1, `` the most powerful, full-function computer for under $ 9,000,'' <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON> claimed. The price does not include disk drives. The machine's speed of 12.5 million instructions per second, <ORGANIZATION> MIPS </ORGANIZATION>, is about four times the speed of similarly priced high-end Macintosh from <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION>, and more than twice as fast as the most powerful IBM-compatible personal computers. Previously, the Sun's fastest RISC machine had a speed of 7 <ORGANIZATION> MIPS </ORGANIZATION> for $ 22,000. The new machine and the revamped older models are designed to capture markets other than the traditional technical ones that for years have relied on machines from Sun and rival Apollo Computer. The companies control about 50 percent of the workstation market. `` This machine is the beginning of Sun getting into the volume market,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, editor of Techologic Computer Letter. <PERSON> Anil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadre </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>'s director of marketing for graphics, predicted the new products will help the company for the first time sell more than 100,000 workstations in a single year. But <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, an analyst at the research firm of <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the power and prices of some of the new products are comparable to others available on the commercial market. Sun is using the SPARC technology, its version of so-called RISC _ reduced instruction set computing _ in an effort to capture a significant share of the burgeoning $ 4 billion workstation market. By the mid 1990s, the market for the machines is expected to be about $ 20 billion annually. Sun also plans to unveil during a two-day conference at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> a library of 500 software packages than can be run on the new systems. Other new products to be announced today include a revamp of the original Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s fast 68030 microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start at $ 5,995; a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at $ 29,900; and an equally fast SPARC system starting at $ 40,900 that is designed to operate as a `` server'' to interact with many computers on a network

 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s wealthy <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family apparently is abandoning a plan to buy <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and choosing instead to enjoy the profits flowing from the Arizona-based hotelier's restructuring efforts. <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> company headed by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, has reduced its stake in Ramada to 4.8 percent from the 7.2 percent it held when it offered last September to buy the company for $ 10 a share, or about $ 368 million. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> rejected the proposal and embarked on a corporate restructuring that includes the sale of its hotel and restaurant businesses and will leave the company with three casinos in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> would not comment Tuesday on the reasons for the stock sale, which was revealed in an April 5 filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Uphoff </PERSON>, a stock analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION> simply saw the restructuring as a better deal. `` I think that when ... it became clear that the restructuring would be completed at a price to shareholders 20 percent higher than the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION> had offered for the company, the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION> decided they would be better served by taking their profits and letting management restructure the company,'' <PERSON> Uphoff </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> probably began buying <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> stock at $ 4 to $ 6 a share. The stock's price has risen from about $ 9 a share to nearly $ 12 since the company announced its restructuring plan. Ramada closed Tuesday at $ 11.75 a share, unchanged from Monday's close <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> said in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that it had sold 959,100 shares of Ramada stock from March 16 through April 5 at an average price of $ 11.29 a share. The sale leaves the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION>, owners of the Hyatt hotel chain and the industrial conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Marmon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with just under 1.9 million shares of Ramada, according to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing. Ramada's restructuring involves the sale of its 825 hotels and <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Callender </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which it acquired in 1986. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> has already agreed to sell the restaurant business to the <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a group of private investors from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and expects to announce the sale of its hotel group by mid-year, said spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` We have n't heard from the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION> since last October so I do n't think we have any comment on what they've just done,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> will retain its hotel-casino operations: the Tropicana resort-casino in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; the newly remodeled <ORGANIZATION> TropWorld </ORGANIZATION> resort-casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION> Laughlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s Fabulous'50s Casino in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 5.1 million for 1988 on revenue of $ 476.6 million The hotel and restaurant operations showed a net loss of $ 3.9 million for the year.

 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to keep alive its $ 2.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> even though the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> banking company has rejected the offer and steadfastly refused to negotiate. `` <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> will proceed with its merger proposal,'' <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday. `` It is time for C & amp; S to stop posturing. The C & amp; S board should promptly begin negotiations with us.'' Citizens' board of directors last week rejected as inadequate the stock-swap propsal by <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> and said it had no plans to discuss the offer further. Citizens repeated its concerns about the bid in a lengthy statement issued Tuesday. It speculated the deal would face numerous legal and regulatory obstacles, primarily because of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> took over the management of the banks of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> last year as part of a government bailout. That bank is now called <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Banking Commissioner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said the regulatory issues involved in the deal could stretch the review process up to 18 months. `` <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> must now recognize the severe disruption and enormous cost to both institutions that could accompany a continuation of the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> bid,'' Citizens said. Industry analysts took note of the aggressive tone of both <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> and Citizens this week. `` They -LRB- Citizens -RRB- took the gloves off,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The only mistake they could make is to not be aggressive enough and look bad and regret it later.'' But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added, `` I do n't expect <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> will just walk away from it. They'll bring out their lawyers' opinions to show where they believe C & amp; S is wrong.'' <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> is offering 1.075 of its shares for each of Citizens' stock, or around $ 40 a share The company has hinted it might be willing to raise its bid by around $ 5 a share if Citizens agrees to negotiations. The combination of the two would result in a bank with assets of around $ 75 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10 among the nation's bank holding companies.

 The stock market headed higher today, adding to Tuesday's moderate gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.98 to 2,320.56 in the first half hour of trading. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 533 up, 378 down and 544 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.60 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said hopes seemed to be building up that the market would get some favorable news on inflation when the government reports Friday on the producer price index of finished goods for March. Wall Street estimates call for the index to show a rise of about 0.5 percent, down from 1 percent in both January and February. That would come as at least a tentative signal that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was seeing some results in its efforts to keep inflation in check. On the other hand, if progress remains slow in the anti-inflation campaign, brokers say fears are likely to mount that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might wind up pushing the economy into a recession with its credit-tightening.

No hearing date was immediately set on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' suit, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> is based <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> and incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLauglin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> set a hearing for Thursday to consider <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an injunction against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to prevent him from negotiating with the carrier's pilots and other union workers. Northwest's suit, also filed Tuesday, contended <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his partnership were illegally interfering with the companies' relations with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> labor unions The suit claimed <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is trying to block completion of a collective bargaining agreement being negotiated between <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and its 5,000-member pilots' union. The suit said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on April 4, the day after he announced his takeover bid in a letter to the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also has talked to the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, which recently agreed to recommend adoption of a proposed new contract for 10,500 clerical workers at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the lawsuit said. In addition, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had talked with the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 6,500 flight attendents. The Northwest suit says <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the partnership he controls, `` are seeking to have the unions negotiate with them, to usurp <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s contractual and statutory role and thereby to interfere with and disrupt <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s prospective and existing contractual and labor relations with its principal unions.'' Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' offer, calling it inadequate. The board also reaffirmed its intention to maintain the nation's fourth-largest airline as an independent entity. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the airline would not comment on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' suit `` at least until we study the complaint.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, meanwhile, called the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> action `` entirely without merit.'' Northwest's board approved the poison pill March 27, saying it wanted to make the company less attractive to a hostile suitor intending to break up the company. The plan would take effect when a person or group acquires 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock or announces a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting power of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock. The plan would allow the company to double the number of existing shares and offer them to shareholders other than the acquirer at half the market price, said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>. The effect would be to require a hostile bidder to buy twice as many shares to gain control of the company, making the bid twice as expensive. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> complained in his suit that the plan would improperly interfere with the solicitation of proxies he expected to conduct in advance of the May 15 shareholders meeting. He is seeking an order to temporarily restrain <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> from distributing special stock-buying rights to shareholders under the pill. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> owns 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. Shortly before he made his offer, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> announced that a separate group of investors was interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. The identity of that group, which owns 4.9 percent of the stock, has not been disclosed.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking panel today amended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan plan to encourage institutions to concentrate on housing lending, but even supporters of the change acknowledged it was worded in a way that could allow S & amp; Ls greater freedom. The amendment, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on financial institutions, requires S & amp; Ls to concentrate 80 percent of their lending on housing, up from the current requirement of 60 percent But, it very broadly defines the types of lending that would be used to meet the 80 percent standard to include consumer, small businesses and education loans. It also would not penalize any institution for its existing mix of investments, even if that did not meet the requirement. `` One can have the advantage of wanting to sound pro-housing and still know that one supports greater latitude,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who supported the amendment. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said his measure `` will build homes and help revitalize our inner cities.'' The 26-18 vote approving it came as the subcommittee began its third day of drafting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened its bill-writing session. Tresury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a letter today to Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., called the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee's recommended changes on regulating the industry `` on balance meritorious'' but said the administration still objects to his plan to put $ 50 billion of taxpayer cost in the bailout on the federal budget Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers are rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s effort to make the savings and loan industry meet the same capital requirements as banks in return for bailing out the thrift industry. By a 27-16 vote, the panel adopted changes, advocated by Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., that would make it easier for S & amp; Ls, through subsidiaries, to invest in such risky areas as commercial real estate development and junk bonds Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, in opposing the amendment, said, `` It's all about whether we want to support risk takers with government guarantees. On Tuesday, the subcommittee rebuffed, 24-23, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence on doubling the required capital base of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls from 3 percen to 6 percent, the same level that commercial banks have to meet. But then in several votes against <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, it endorsed elimination of several `` smoke and mirror'' accounting practices that allow S & amp; L owners to meet the present capital standards with little or no investment of their own. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, before today's session, had reached a bipartisan consensus behind closed doors `` on nearly all issues,'' according to its chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. One <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, predicted its version will be much tougher than whatever emerges from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in regulating S & amp; Ls in the future But <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> conceded in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> that financing the taxpayer portion of the bailout `` remains unresolved.'' And committee sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, predicted a party-line fight on the issue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to raise the $ 50 billion immediate taxpayer share of the bailout through 30-year bonds to be issued by a new quasi-governmental corporation as a way to prevent the costs from showing up on the federal deficit this year and next. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, with support from congressional auditors and `` acquiescence'' of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., wants to put the bulk of the costs in the fiscal 1989 budget, saying it would save taxpayers $ 4.5 billion in lower interest costs over three decades In his letter dated Monday to <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said he was aware of the treasury secretary's threat earlier this month that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto the bill if the bailout costs are included in the 1989 or 1990 budget deficits. `` We have made substantial movement toward the administration's direction on the regulatory and structural aspects but have yet to see any flexibility from you on the funding dimension,'' he complained In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has drafted an amendment similar to <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s financing scheme. But <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said he is waiting for the `` appropriate time'' to introduce it, presumably after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee has a showdown vote on the issue. Seven Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel joined 17 Democrats in the 24-23 vote Tuesday rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to make S & amp; L owners have $ 6 instead of $ 3 in capital for every $ 100 they lend out. Eleven Democrats sided with 12 Republicans in a failed effort to reject the adopted alternative scheme introduced by <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>. The Annunzio-Parris measure maintains the current 3 percent capital floor but for the first time requires that half that amount _ $ 1.50 on every $ 100 in loans _ be real cash investment by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners that can be recovered if the thrift fails. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> cited <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 1,100 S & amp; Ls would falter under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital standards and claimed his measure is tougher in some ways because it requires owners to put their own money at risk.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today added to legislation to increase the minimum wage an unrelated amendment increasing by roughly $ 1,000 the amount of outside income Social Security recipients are allowed to earn before facing benefit cutbacks. The amendment, passed 86-11, was one of more than a dozen up for consideration today before a final vote on the minimum-wage bill, which calls for raising the hourly base wage from its current $ 3.35 to $ 4.55 by October 1991. The slow pace of the debate on amendments threatened to push the final vote back until Thursday. Passage of the amendment offered by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., also brought the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill far out of line with a House-passed bill, meaning that after final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage a conference committee would be needed to draft a compromise The current outside earnings limit is $ 8,880 for Social Security recipients 65 years of age or older. After crossing that limit recipients lose $ 1 of benefits for every $ 2 in earned income. The amendment would increase the limit for most of those affected to $ 9,960. It would apply to Social Security recipients between the ages of 65 and 70. The earnings limit expires after age 70. Most of the senators who spoke against the amendment said they supported its goal but questioned the appropriateness of adding it to the minimum-wage bill. They also said that benefits to thousands of Social Security recipients likely would have to be cut to pay for the proposal. The amendment is not related to the mininum wage but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules do not prohibit tacking on other proposals to legislation being considered by the full body. An impasse between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic congressional leadership that threatens prospects for a higher minimum wage has both sides trying to convince the public the other side is to blame. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will veto the Democratic plan, a development that could lead to a ninth consecutive year without an increase in the minimum wage despite the first White House support this decade for some boost. Polls have shown the public overwhelmingly supports an increase, a fact not lost during the partisan wrangling. `` This legislation will be a test of whether we indeed are seeking a kinder, gentler nation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Tuesday, criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to budge from his proposal, which would raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.25 an hour by January 1992. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` kinder, gentler'' campaign rhetoric is at odds with his opposition to the Democratic bill, particularly when the president is backing expanded tax breaks for capital gains enjoyed largely by the nation's wealthy. `` How can anyone justify wanting to give $ 30,000-a-year tax cuts to the richest Americans and at the same time oppose 30 cents an hour more for the poorest Americans?'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` That's not right. It's wrong. It's unfair.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> spoke just before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, 58-41, largely along party lines, and instead amended a bill by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., to bring it more in line with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill That revision was approved, 61-39. The administration fired back quickly, with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> raising the prospect that the partisan squabbling would result in no increase in the minimum wage this year. `` Democrats have no one to blame but themselves,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` The Democrats decided they'd rather fight than win. Unfortunately, the people who really lose are the ones who can least afford it.'' In addition to favoring a smaller increase in the general minimum wage, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted on letting employers pay new workers a sub-minimum `` training wage.'' Democrats, who long opposed a sub-minimum, agreed this year to include one in their proposal in hopes of making it more acceptable to the administration. The Kennedy bill, as amended, contains a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for up to 60 days; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted on a six-month training wage. Republicans, however, are confident a veto can be upheld and are in no mood for a compromise on the overall dispute. `` There is n't going to be a compromise,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` It's going to be $ 4.25 an hour and a six-month training wage, period.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced today it will buy <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a pioneer in the engineering workstation market, for $ 476 million in cash. The purchase of Apollo by <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of computers and scientific equipment, continues its push into the $ 3.8 billion workstation market. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> will offer $ 13.25 per share for Apollo's estimated 36 million shares of common stock outstanding and will begin its tender offer within five business days. The companies' board of directors unanimously approved the definitive agreement that will merge two players in the engineering workstation market, the fastest-growing area of the computer industry. Workstations are single-user computers that resemble personal computers but are usually faster and have larger screens with better graphics. They were originally used mostly by scientists and engineers. But the use of workstations, which range in price from $ 5,000 to $ 100,000, has spread to other professions such as financial analysis. Apollo, a Fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in <LOCATION> Chelmsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, pioneered engineering workstations but fell behind <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the rapidly growing market. The company squeezed out a profit of $ 2.1 million last year on sales of $ 654 million, although it lost money in its second and third quarters. After the second-quarter loss, which surprised analysts, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampel </PERSON> resigned as president to become president of <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Apollo's stock had risen earlier this year on speculation that it might be taken over, possibly by <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> But the stock drifted back as the speculation faded. Apollo closed unchanged at $ 8.12 -LCB- a share Tuesday in over-the-counter trading. Palo Alto-based <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> entered its 50th year of business in 1989 following a financially rosy 1988 when it reported a 27 percent jump in net income, a 34 percent rise in earnings per share and revenue of $ 9.8 billion. `` HP and Apollo together represent an ideal blending of product strengths and business strategies,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. Young, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer. `` Both companies are recognized for technical innovation and high-quality computer products, and for a commitment to the industry's move toward cooperative-computing environments based on open industry standards.'' The acquisition is agreement is subject to regulatory approval and the expiration of waiting periods. `` Apollo is extremely pleased to join forces with one of the industry's outstanding organizations,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderslice </PERSON>, Apollo's chairman and chief executive officer.

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Loewenbraeu company of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s best-known beer-makers with origins that date to the 14th century, is considering direct exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after watching falling sales of its licensed brew in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But Loewenbraeu general manager and director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiedemann </PERSON> emphasizes direct export is just one option under consideration, and praises the cooperation with licensing partner <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. `` We have an excellent business and personal relationship with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wiedemann </PERSON> emphasized in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But he said that in an effort to raise flagging sales, `` among the various options that we have, there could also possibly be the resumption of direct exports.'' He confirmed published reports that annual sales of the licensed Loewenbraeu on the American market, which began under a pact made in the early 1970s, has dropped by nearly a third since then. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loewenbraeu </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the licensed product is brewed in Miller-run <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breweries. Direct exports means Loewenbraeu would ship its beer made in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The remarks by <PERSON> Wiedemann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> appeared to surprise officials at <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION>, a leading American brewer, which has a contract with Loewenbraeu that runs through 1992. `` Quite frankly, I'm really puzzled by what they said,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurkowski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman reached by telephone. `` The very nature of that contract would prevent some of those other options from taking place.'' She said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Loewenbraeu officials conferred in February, a meeting she said the West German company found highly encouraging. The Lowenbraeu general manager suggested that in the future, both companies might collaborate on direct exports of Loewenbraeu to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He declined to be more specific. Loewenbraeu already has formed a company in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Loewenbraeu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to study the possibility of direct exports and to look into other possibilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wiedemann </PERSON> said. `` Because our sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are down, we must undertake decisive strategy changes,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Loewenbraeu </ORGANIZATION> executive said. He acknowledged that the higher price for export beer is one consideration weighed by officials of the 606-year-old brewery. The general manager noted <ORGANIZATION> Loewenbraeu </ORGANIZATION> is considering the purchase of a brewing facility on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s northern coast, near seaports and much closer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than the current facilities deep in southern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. `` That way we do n't just have <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a possible market, we also have a substantial export business in the whole world,'' <PERSON> Wiedemann </PERSON> said. He added: `` The beer we would brew there, if in fact we buy a brewery, would be made according to the same recipe as we have here in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>.'' The northern facility also could figure into Loewenbraeu's plans to become a dominant brand within this country of 61.3 million people. `` Among the approximately 1,150 breweries now in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, there is none with a market share of more than 5 percent. There are so many suppliers, and there is no truly national brand,'' he said. End adv for weekend editions April 15-16

 Prices on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange ended slightly higher in quiet trading Wednesday, as the market's early euphoria wore off by the afternoon. Driving prices higher from the outset of trading was news that <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to merge, a move that would create the world's second largest pharmaceutical company. But dealers said there was n't sufficient retail interest to sustain the gains and prices began heading lower at late morning. Nervousness ahead of Thursday's release of British employment and average earnings data also pulled the market down, dealers said. The figures, along with Friday's retail price statistics, could provide further insight into the outlook for inflation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February, due on Friday, also sidelined a number of players, dealers said. At the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index was up 1.7 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,033.0.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the largest investor in home mortgages, on Wednesday reported a 65 percent rise in its first quarter income over a year ago.

 Most grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of new Soviet buying interest in the wheat market. But oat futures retreated, reflecting the abundance of foreign oats available on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market.

Rumors surfaced at midday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was eyeing new purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, which would be a significant development because the Soviets have already purchased all the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat earmarked for sale to them this year at subsidized prices. The moderate decline in oat futures was overdue, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Homan </PERSON>, an independent oat trader in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We've needed to divorce ourselves from the strength of the other grain markets,'' he said. `` There's a scarcity of American oats but an abundance of foreign oats.'' At the close, wheat was 2 -LCB- cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.03 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.67 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.79 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.27 a bushel

 Stocks rose again Wednesday in a session marked by takeover deals and mild optimism about the outlook for interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.07 to 2,319.65, adding to its 9.71-point gain on Tuesday. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 818 up, 618 down and 542 unchanged. Traders were looking ahead to Friday's flood of economic reports, including widely watched ones on wholesale prices, merchandise trade, industrial production and factory use. Any indication of a slowdown would ease fears of inflation and thus take pressure off the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates as a way of cooling off the economy. High interest rates have siphoned money from stocks into the credit market. `` It's awfully hard to compete with 10 percent CDs and 9.5 percent Treasuries,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON>, a broker-analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hummer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The bond market was basically flat Wednesday as traders awaited the economic reports, but stocks edged higher, continuing a gradual and uneven uptrend. So far this year the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average has risen just under 7 percent. `` This is building in a very gradual and I think a healthy fashion. There has been no explosion of euphoria. Good, solid base-building is what appears to be going on,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, research director at <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The volume of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was the second highest in what has been a quiet month on Wall Street. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 165.20 million shares, up from 146.83 million in the previous session. That was just below the volume of 165.88 million last Wednesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 195.46 million shares. On the deal-making front, <PERSON> SmithKline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> announced an agreement to merge with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s stock was the most actively traded <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issue, falling 2 to 62 -RCB- on volume of more than 4.6 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to buy Apollo Computer, a workstation maker, for 13 -LRB- a share or $ 476 million.

 The dollar ended mixed against major currencies in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading Wednesday after increasing slightly abroad. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 387 for a troy ounce of gold, up $ 2.10 from Tuesday's late bid. Trading activity was kept in check by speculation about possible central bank intervention and reluctance on the part of dealers to take major new positions ahead of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reports on retail sales Thursday and merchandise trade and producer prices Friday. A dealer at a major Japanese bank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said traders `` are ultra-cautious and reluctant to test the central bank's resolve until the release of the data later this week,'' Political difficulties for the governments in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> caused some dealers to sell yen and marks, which helped strengthen the dollar marginally. The dollar began its trading day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with a rise of 0.23 Japanese yen to a closing level of 132.85 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was trading higher at 132.95 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it finished at 133.025, up from 132.705 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6925 to buy one pound compared with $ 1.6995 late Tuesday. By the time trading was done for the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.69215 vs. $ 1.6910 Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.88275 West German marks, down from 1.88525; 1.66475 Swiss francs, up from 1.66375; 6.3615 French francs, down from 6.3655; 1,380.50 Italian lire, down from 1,381.375; and, 1.18955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18945 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8857 West German marks, up from 1.8825; 1.6645 Swiss francs, up from 1.6582; 6.3690 French francs, up from 6.3535; 2.1270 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1225; 1,381.00 Italian lire, up from 1,379.25; 1.1887 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1888. Gold bullion prices strengthened in trading at home and abroad. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a troy ounce of gold for current delivery ended at $ 388.20 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up from Tuesday's $ 385.80 Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 387.25 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 385.25.

 <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday they would merge and form the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company, but a Wall Street analyst warned that either firm could find itself a takeover target before the transaction is completed <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>, who confirmed earlier this month they were negotiating on a merger, said they would exchange stock and establish a pharmaceutical and health care giant with estimated sales of $ 6.7 billion. The new company, to be named <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION>, would rank second in worldwide pharmaceutical sales behind <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, second in over-the-counter medicines behind <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and fourth in animal health. The firm will have a research and development budget of more than $ 500 million per year, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We will have one of the best and largest research and development organizations in the world, drawing on the scientific skills and traditions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' he said. Under the merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive five `` B'' shares of stock in the new company for each of their old shares, and <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> shareholders would receive slightly less than one `` A'' share for each of their old shares. The new shares would have equal voting rights in the affairs of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> but dividends paid to each `` A'' share would be about five times the dividends paid to each `` B'' share. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> currently has some 133 million shares outstanding and <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> has about 768 million shares outstanding. Two <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION>, an eye - and skin-care business, and 84 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, which makes diagnostic and laboratory equipment, would be spun off to <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, the companies said in a joint statement <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> last fall sold 16 percent of <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> through a public stock offering. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> plans to sell off its cosmetics and fragrance divisions, plus other non-pharmaceutical businesses, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive a one-time cash dividend of $ 5.50 per share. They also would get about half a share of <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> and about 0.18 shares of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> stock for each <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> share, according to a news release. The merger would be subject to governmental approval and a vote by shareholders of both companies. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> stock fell $ 2 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Wednesday, closing at $ 62.75 a share. A financial analyst specializing in pharmaceutical companies said the merger announcement could draw new bids for either company before stockholders vote four months from now. `` To quote <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON>, ` It is n't over till it's over,''' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think that's why they attempted to announce this deal in all due haste.'' Other companies mentioned as possible suitors for <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> had received no other offers `` There have been no feelers, no nudges, no cloakroom conversations,'' he said when pressed on the question. But <PERSON> Normann </PERSON> said the announcement could change the situation. `` Think how short the concept of this merger has been in the public domain,'' he said. `` And its such a large deal _ $ 11 to $ 13 billion, depending on what you think about the pieces. ... `` Now, X, Y, Z, who ever that might be, knows exactly what the terms are that they have to top.'' <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, 55, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>, would become chairman of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>, would become chief executive officer of the new company. The two companies executed agreements Wednesday to co-promote several products, including <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s popular ulcer drug Tagamet. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> was granted a license to sell the drug under its own brand name. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>, which makes Tums antacid pills, is particulary interested in developing an over-the-counter version of Tagamet, <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> said. `` Building on the ` Tums' franchise, an over-the-counter formulation of ` Tagamet' has the potential to become a global brand,'' he said in a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> reported total sales of $ 4.7 billion in 1988, while <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s sales exceeded $ 4 billion. The new company would be based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with offices in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>.

 Gasoline futures prices surged higher in moderate trading Wednesday, fueled by rising consumer demand. Strength in the gasoline pits helped push crude prices up, while heating oil had a weaker day. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unleaded gasoline for May delivery rose 1.11 cents to 70.11 cents a gallon. Most other contract months were higher. The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, edged up 1 penny to close the day at $ 20.64 a barrel. June and July showed no gains or losses while other months rose between 2 cents and 10 cents a barrel. Heating oil for May delivery declined .03 cent to 53.20 cents a gallon with other contract months mixed. Analysts said world demand for gasoline is continuing strong in the wake of the Alaskan oil spill nearly three weeks ago. `` A lot of strength is coming out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had a mild winter and people have been driving more.'' In addition, new anti-pollution regulations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also are affecting demand, analysts said. Contributing to the weakness in crude prices was a weekly report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> showing a 500,000-barrel increase in crude inventories for the week ending April 7. Market participants had expected a sharp downturn in inventories because of the Alaskan spill, traders said.

<HEAD>Palladium Cracks $170, A 5{-Year High, On Fusion Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Palladium futures prices surged to their highest level in nearly 5 -LCB- years Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid optimism that recent nuclear fusion experiments could spur demand for the metal as an ingredient in the power plants of tomorrow. Other precious-metal futures prices also advanced. On other markets, cocoa futures plunged; gasoline prices rose but other energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Palladium settled $ 4.40 to $ 5.15 higher with the contract for delivery in June at $ 173.65 a troy ounce. The move marked palladium's first foray above $ 170 since December 1983, when the metal reached nearly $ 180 a troy ounce. Palladium prices have risen in 10 of the 13 trading sessions since March 23, when two chemists announced they had achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using palladium as a catalyst in an experiment at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. Fusion is the joining together of hydrogen atoms to produce enormous amounts of energy. It is the process that powers the sun and stars, and scientists seeking a cheap energy source have long sought to harness it. Last week, palladium for June delivery went as high as $ 169 an ounce only to collapse on Friday amid skepticism about the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> findings. But on Monday, researchers at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> announced they had replicated at least part of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> results, bringing new buyers into the usually quiet palladium market. Some of the buying interest in palladium spilled over into the platinum market Wednesday. `` The rally in palladium created a psychological environment which was conducive to rallies in the other precious metals,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But analysts said the moderate rise in gold and silver futures was more likely a response to inflation jitters and signs that the dollar's recent strength has peaked. Platinum settled $ 3.30 to $ 3.80 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> with May at $ 531.80 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 2.20 to $ 2.40 higher with June at $ 392.10 a troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 4.2 cents higher with May at $ 5.895 a troy ounce. Cocoa futures plummeted on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on rumors that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's largest cocoa producer, had sold an unknown quantity of cocoa through the Swiss trade house Intercafco, which denied any such deal. Cocoa settled $ 30 to $ 56 lower with May at $ 1,272 per metric ton. Unleaded gasoline futures rose sharply for the fourth straight day on supply concerns. The crude - and heating-oil market were quiet West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 6 cents higher with May at $ 20.64 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to 5 cents lower with May at 53.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent lower to 1.11 cents higher with May at 70.11 cents a gallon. Most grain and soybean futures prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of new Soviet buying interest in the wheat market. But oat futures retreated, reflecting the abundance of foreign oats available on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. Wheat settled 2 cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 4.03 a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.67 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.79 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents higher with May at $ 7.27 -LCB- a bushel On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, weak cash markets and profit-taking weighed on the cattle futures while pork futures advanced on ideas that farmers soon will be busy with spring planting and will be marketing fewer hogs. Live cattle settled .87 cent lower to .60 cent higher with April at 76.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .93 cent lower with April at 76.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent to .38 cent higher with April at 39.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .28 cent higher with May at 33.30 cents a pound.

<HEAD>IMF Loan Could Bolster Mexico's Standing In Talks With Commercial

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s latest $ 3.65 billion loan from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> will likely improve its standing in upcoming debt restructuring talks with commercial bank creditors, bank executives said Wednesday. Negotiations between the country and a 13-member bank committee are set to begin April 19 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At that time, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will formally propose a reduction in the value of its foreign debt, a cut in servicing and additional lending over several years, according to <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will offer banks the option of exchanging old debt for Mexican bonds that discount debt principal and reduce interest rates. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, struggling to overcome the burden of payments to commercial banks and governments on its $ 107 billion foreign debt, is the developing world's second-largest debtor behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which owes $ 121 billion. The three-year agreement reached with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday is the first from the international lending community since <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> outlined a debt-reduction plan last month that he hoped would help ease payment terms on the developing world's $ 1.32 trillion foreign debt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> pact `` is a positive signal as it forms an important part of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic program. `` It will help facilitate negotiations with the bank advisory group'' next week, he said in a statement. The $ 3.65 billion <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> loan will be used to bolster the country's foreign exchange reserves and spur economic development <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said the agreement `` is a fundamental change from the past,'' since the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> recognizes <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s need to set its growth priorities first and schedule debt servicing accordingly. Many bankers agreed that the pact amounted to an endorsement of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic policies, which included tough inflation-fighting programs. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is a country that has made significant progress. It deserves whatever kind of special treatment might be meted out,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> and an advisor to the bank creditors committee.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it settled allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> discriminated against foreign-born job applicants. The issue was raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION>' Rights, which brought the charges on behalf of a job applicant who wished to remain anonymous, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Siskind </PERSON> of the department's Office of Special Counsel. The center alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> was requiring that foreign-born applicants for bank tellers show `` green cards,'' known formally as alien registration cards, even though they already had provided adequate documentation to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That act, among other things, required employers to ensure that they did not hire illegal aliens, and threatened them with fines if they failed to do so. `` In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, it was discriminating against foreign-born employees by forcing them to produce documents that it was n't forcing its other employees to produce,'' <PERSON> Siskind </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> deems drivers licenses, school identity cards with photographs, voter registration cards and draft cards, among other documents, as sufficient to establish identity. Although the allegation against <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> focused on just one individual, <PERSON> Siskind </PERSON> said, `` We did learn that they had been doing it as a policy. They had instructed their personnel people to do that, but as soon as we began our investigation and informed them of the law, they agreed to stop the policy.'' The investigation began Jan. 27 and was settled Monday, he said. In the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept any and all documents allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to satisfy the requirement that the person is eligible for employment and agreed to treat all applicants and employees the same. It will not pay any fine to the government or any back pay to the affected individual, who was subsequently hired, <PERSON> Siskind </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> asked a federal judge to end his three-year prison term but prosecutors Wednesday refused to take a stand on releasing the former speculator at the center of Wall Street's insider trading scandals. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who has already served one year in prison, claimed that his help led to a record plea bargain deal by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the subsequent indictment of its junk bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others on racketeering and securities fraud charges. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s lawyers on Tuesday asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> to reduce his sentence to time already served, which would allow his speedy release. `` The true fruits of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s unsurpassed cooperation with the government are now _ for the first time _ dramatically, fully and publicly known,'' the court papers said. The papers claimed <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was `` to a significant extent a follower in a larger criminal conspiracy organized and operated'' by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and its high-yield bond department headed by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. The 98-count indictment of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, handed up March 29, alleged that the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bondsman illegally schemed with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to defraud clients and the investing public by manipulating stock prices and skirting federal securities laws during attempted takeovers. In a letter to <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, who sentenced <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in December 1987, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said `` the government takes no position'' on <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s move, but acknowledged his cooperation in the almost three-year probe into Wall Street corruption. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Fardella </PERSON>, writing on behalf of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, noted that `` the fruits of his cooperation are now more vividly apparent to the public.'' <PERSON> Fardella </PERSON> described the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> indictment and the $ 650 million tentative settlement of criminal charges <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> reached with the government as `` the centerpiece of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation.'' The letter continued: `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s disclosures were the essential catalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in those cases. Other investigations arising directly from <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s disclosures have also matured since <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s sentencing. But it added that `` the government nevertheless articulated the value of that cooperation in unqualified terms when <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was sentenced.'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said: `` I will have no comment while it's under consideration by the court.'' Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potential takeover targets, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one felony count as part of his plea bargain. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, 52, also agreed to pay a then-record $ 100 million to settle civil insider trading charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. On April 15, 1988, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> filed papers seeking a sentence reduction but asked <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> to defer action. Attorneys again deferred the request in October and said last week they planned to seek his release following <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s long-awaited indictment. The lawyers Tuesday said that `` public ` blood lust''' at the time of sentencing could n't be countered. `` As the court recognized at sentencing, it was impossible for the public or the press to understand the incalculable value of Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation because the secrecy of the grand jury process precluded any public recitation of the value of the information that he had provided to the government,'' it said. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was eligible for parole March 21, two days before his one-year anniversary inside the minimum security prison camp in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the one-time corporate titan is working as an orderly. he has not yet sought parole. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has supplied information used toward civil or criminal charges in more than a dozen case in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In exchange, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was allowed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. His earliest non-parole release date based on good behavior is April 4, 1990. At the time of sentencing, prosecutors said <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s three-year term `` was an appropriate sentence in light of all the competing factors.'' They also said that while <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> provided a `` window on the rampant criminal conduct'' in the securities industry he also `` engaged in serious and widespread criminal conduct.''

<HEAD>Big Eight Accounting Firm Names Heads of Restructured Business Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s new chief executive announced the heads of the accounting giant's restructured operations Wednesday and said he was eager to pursue more business after a tumultuous year. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON>, confirmed last week to head the firm, said the restructuring has created a consulting unit that will operate independently and on an equal basis with its accounting, audit and tax business unit. The consulting practice will be headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, 44, who had headed its North American consulting business. He had previously been the southeast regional managing partner. The accounting, audit and tax practice will be headed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Measelle </PERSON>, 50, who had previously been managing partner for worldwide accounting and audit practice. He has worked in <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s offices in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Both will report to <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON>. `` The good news is that we have completed our restructuring, successfully gaining consensus among our partners worldwide and we are moving aggressively forward,'' <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON> said. He said 89 percent of the partners voting on the restructuring approved it. <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON>, 49, a 28-year veteran of firm who worked his way up through the accounting side, was nominated last month and approved last week to succeed <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> as managing partner and chief executive of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, a privately-held firm based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> announced in January he was stepping down after nine years as head of <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> to help give the firm a new start as it embarked on a restructuring designed partly to end a rift between its accounting division and its more rapidly-growing management information consulting division. The consulting business accounted for roughly 40 percent of the firm's $ 2.8 billion in revenue last year. <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON> said revenue from from consulting rose more than 30 percent last year, while its revenue from its tax practice was up 20 percent and audit and accounting revenue rose 14 percent. `` This organization is back to work,'' <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON> said, adding the firm could once again focus full attention on competing in the marketplace. Under questioning, he said the firm has lost no clients but said it may not have capitalized on marketplace opportunities. During the past year, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> has been rocked by the defections of six consulting partners, who have set up their own consulting business with assistance from the London-based advertising giant <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm formed by <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s former partners, are suing each other, each claiming business interference.

<DATELINE>SHANNON, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest aircraft leasing companies, said Wednesday it will announce the largest aircraft order in history next week, saying it plans to order airplanes and engines worth between $ 11 billion and $ 20 billion The Ireland-based company's chief operating officer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said he is ordering a mix of airplane models manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> joint venture aircraft maker. The planes will include wide-bodied and narrow-bodied planes and engines and will be the largest order ever, he said. Details of the order and the companies lined up to lease the aircraft will be announced next Tuesday, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. The order includes engines supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> CFMI </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes and would be worth almost $ 20 billion. Asked about these figures, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, `` While I can not confirm a precise number to you, the suggestion is substantially correct. It's in the region of 200 aircraft.'' He indicated that a figure somewhere between $ 11 billion and $ 20 billion would be nearer the total value of the order. The largest previous order was by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> last September for 225 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> planes worth $ 10.5 billion. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION>, said the deal would leave the company three times larger than its nearest competitors in the aircraft leasing field. The Engineer magazine reported that <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> will supply engines for 50 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s likely to be involved in the order. British Aerospace will make the wings for the Airbus A330s and A320s which may also be fitted with <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> engines, the magazine said. GPA has already ordered 40 A320s. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> could also win orders for MD-11 and MD-80 aircraft and the former may also carry <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> engines, the magazine said.

<HEAD>Motorola Profit Up Nearly 8 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 7.9 percent gain in first-quarter profit Wednesday, citing the continued rapid growth of its computer chip and cellular telephone businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 123 million, or 95 cents a share, for the three months ending April 1, compared with $ 114 million, or 88 cents a share, for the same period in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s sales for the first quarter totaled $ 2.18 billion, up 11 percent from the $ 1.96 billion in the first quarter of 1988, the Schaumburg-based company said. The company said both the sales and earnings figures were record highs for a first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> said lower profits in its communications group, which produces two-way radio and paging equipment, were more than offset by higher profits in its semiconductor and general-systems groups. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> expressed confidence that the company's growth would continue. `` Significant product introductions, combined with steadily increasing levels of quality and customer satisfaction, give us the opportunity to gain greater shares of global markets,'' he said. During the quarter the semiconductor unit unveiled its new 68040 microprocessor, the first computer chip to contain more than 1.2 million transistors. The division enjoyed an 11 percent sales increase during the first quarter. The general systems group saw its sales jump 58 percent, due largely to continued strong orders for <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s cellular telephone equipment and the introduction of several new computer products.

<TEXT>
 The upstart company that sparked the desktop computer industry's trend toward higher-powered and speedier machines on Wednesday unveiled a new generation of products _ faster and mightier than before. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, hailed the line for `` ease-of-use features found, before now, only in personal computers.'' Surrounded by dazzling displays of multicolored canvas artwork at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Civic Auditorium, analysts and industry members generally reacted favorably to <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>'s machines. But not all are convinced the company can beat similar products already released or planned by major competitors, including Apollo Computer, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>' Next Computer System and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` These are beautiful machines, clearly intended to push the company into a bigger market,'' said software designer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. `` But are these machines the right price, the right design with the right capabilities for the business, school and personal-use market?'' he asked. `` Or do the ` other guys' have a more suitable product for the business desktop? Only time will tell.'' Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater speed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics capabilities, sometimes including 3-D. Some models of Sun's new line, priced from $ 5,995 to $ 73,900, include or can add sophisticated new graphics and digital sound capabilities, higher speeds and a $ 12,900 circuit board that allows full-motion video on a computer screen, which can be used for teleconferencing. The new and revamped products from the company, which last year had a 28.3 percent share of the $ 4 billion annual workstation market, are intended to capture a major share of the burgeoning commercial market for workstations. By the mid 1990s, the total annual workstation market is expected to be $ 20 billion. For most of the last decade, workstations were used primarily by scientists and engineers. The company's success for its new line is pinned on its comparatively vast library of software available for it. Competitors so far have fewer few software packages for their machines. The company's SPARCstation 1, the so-called `` star'' of the new line, will have the ability, for an additional $ 500, to emulate the MS-DOS operating system of <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That will allow the SPARCstation to run popular programs written for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> personal computers, although at a lower speed SPARCstation 1's $ 8,995 pricetag does not include a disk drive. Its speed of 12.5 million instructions per second, or <ORGANIZATION> MIPS </ORGANIZATION>, is about four times the speed of the similarly priced high-end Macintosh from <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> and more than twice as fast as the most powerful IBM-compatible personal computers. Previously, Sun's fastest machine using so-called reduced instruction computing set technology, or RISC, had a speed of 7 mips and was priced at $ 22,000. Sun's version of RISC is called SPARC. The SPARCstation 1 offers built-in digital audio capability, eight megabytes of internal memory, three expansion slots, a black-and-white screen and a size that is less than half the height of a traditional PC console. A color-monitor version is available for $ 15,500. Other new products announced included a revamp of the original Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s fast 68030 microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start at $ 5,995; a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at $ 29,900; and an equally-fast SPARC system starting at $ 40,900 that is designed to operate as a `` server'' to interact with many computers on a network. <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it plans to incorporate SPARC technology in future engineering workstations. With this strategy, Sun hopes to turn its SPARC-based systems into an industry standard. Other manufacturers offer machines that compare with Sun's new models: <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> offers an eight megabyte internal memory workstation, without disks, with a speed of 14 <ORGANIZATION> MIPS </ORGANIZATION> for $ 11,900, but no expansion slots; Data General offers one with 17 <ORGANIZATION> MIPS </ORGANIZATION> for $ 7,450, but with only four megabytes of internal memory and no expansion slots. <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s machine at $ 9995 will offer five <ORGANIZATION> MIPS </ORGANIZATION> with three expanson slots and 256-megabytes of optical disk storage capacity and eight megabytes of internal memory.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unanimously approved President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 90 billion plan for bailing out the savings and loan industry after rejecting an effort by the panel's chairman to dump the $ 50 billion immediate taxpayer portion of the cost onto the 1989 federal budget. The 21-member panel voted 11-10 to establish a quasi-government corporation for issuing 30-year bonds to finance the government's share _ as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted _ instead of the on-budget alternative advocated by <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. Democratic <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> sided with all but one of the committee's nine Republicans in favoring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan over <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s. But <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> himself admitted he had lost enthusiasm for the proposal after <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> repeatedly told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats throughout Wednesday he would recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the legislation if it swelled the budget deficit. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> throughout the day, said the administration's opposition would have made the effort to solve the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis `` drag on for months.'' `` The secretary of treasury was absolutely adamant there would be a presidentia veto and we would be back to square one,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> wrote a letter to senators in which he did n't repeat the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto threat, but did say the administration opposed <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s plan Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the chief advocate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> of such a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving a letter Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989. If <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc on efforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and 1991. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has the sole power to make that decision but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him. <PERSON> Riege </PERSON> said his plan would avoid the `` accounting and budget gimmickry'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal by reducing the interest costs of financing the bailout through direct <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing at a savings of $ 4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, the committee's ranking Republican, said he still has a `` fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailout costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been exceeded. All three versions _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's and one being put together in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommitee _ would use the $ 50 billion over the next three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls in 1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so. They also provide for an additional $ 33 billion _ $ 300 million a year of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thrift insolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest rates continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession. `` The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we've done,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said `` We've given him a strong bill with many streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a repeat of what's happened in the past.'' Unlike changes made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's version retains <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to double by June 1991 the required capital that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L operators must have to qualify for federal deposit insurance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that standard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue growing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages and consumer loans. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, which finished its third full day of drafting the bill, rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s measure to make S & amp; Ls have the same minimum capital requirements as banks _ $ 6 for every $ 100 of outstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor _ $ 3 for every $ 100 in loans _ but requiring for the first time that half that amount be in real money. Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of what critics call `` smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.'' Those accounting practices have allowed S & amp; Ls to escape putting up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such items as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, `` good will,'' their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices. By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted to continue allowing S & amp; Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiaries to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate development, fast food franchises and junk bonds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's version would phase out such practices over five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel also approved Wednesday a measure by its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, requiring S & amp; Ls to concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages, compared with the 60 percent now required. But the measure also broadly defines housing to include consumer, education and small business loans and no <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L would be penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet the requirement. The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the full committee, which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed property from failed S & amp; Ls for housing poor people. It authorizes spending $ 574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer discounts or low-interest loans to purchasers. It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing government oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the dumping of the property at firesale prices.

 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s proposed $ 464 million purchase of strike-bound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> collapsed Wednesday but a federal bankruptcy judge immediately moved to attract new buyers for the carrier. The former baseball commissioner told a news conference his deal fell through following an impasse Tuesday night with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are extremely disappointed this transaction collapsed last night and is done,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> told a news conference `` Our agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is terminated, it's finished, it's over.'' His announcement squelched a stunning but short-lived effort to buy one of the nation's most unprofitable and strife-ridden airlines, which has been mired in an emotional strike and bankruptcy proceedings for more than a month. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said the Miami-based airline's strategy now was to reorganize as a smaller carrier serving roughly 50 percent to 60 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights a day and employing some 15,000 to 18,000 people, compared with 31,000 before the strike Bakes refused to answer whether the airline would consider new buyout offers. He denied that a competing offer had been made by <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who nevertheless has indicated he remained interested. But shortly after the announcement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> ordered the parties involved in the sale to show why he should not throw the airline open to all bidders _ and include with it certain assets <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has bought or transferred from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> since acquiring it in 1986. The order is based on a petition by an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditor, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Moreton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, that seeks to block the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle for $ 365 million to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. The petition also seeks to require that any purchase of Eastern be for $ 615 million, the amount <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> paid for it in 1986; include all of its System One computerized reservation system, which it sold to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>; and include aircraft it has transferred to sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> scheduled a hearing Monday on the matter for all parties involved in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy case and <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s attorneys. The key issue blocking the sale to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> was who would run the airline in an interim period between the completion of a deal and the airline's emergence from bankruptcy. `` We were not able to bridge this hurdle although both of us I think tried to do that,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said. According to a participant in the talks, who asked not to be identified, court-appointed examiner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> recommended Monday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> name former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> trustee. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> objected to the appointment of any trustee and <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> refused to name one without explaining why, the source said. Eastern's unions have accused <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of gross mismanagement and of stripping Eastern of vital assets since <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought the airline in 1986, and have refused to return to work while he was in charge. The pilots and Machinists already have petitioned <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> to appoint a trustee. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> saying the union was disappointed and noting the problems that caused the strike remained unresolved. `` This is but one act in a multi-act play, and the bankruptcy judge still is running the proceedings,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> stated. `` I'm disappointed to say the least,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, a Machininsts union general chairman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I can tell you right now, Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would have walked away in this deal with a lot more money than he put into <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Obviously they've got some plans to milk some more out of Eastern.'' At Eastern corporate headquarters, management employees gathered around television sets and expressed relief. `` It looks like we move on to another phase,'' veteran spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said. `` I do think there is a certain release of anxiety here at the base, where a great many people particularly the non-contract people were increasingly concerned at the way the situation had been building.'' <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> met earlier Wednesday with attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its unions and the <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> group to try to save the deal, saying it represented a historic opportunity to salvage one of the nation's biggest airlines Any deal would have required full agreement from <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three unions and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors. Eastern has been flying only a fraction of its schedule since its Machinists union began a strike March 4 that has been supported by its flight attendants and pilots unions. In a related development Wednesday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> upheld the Eastern's pilots participation in the Machinists strike. The ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> seriously hurt the company's effort to get the airline flying again. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he saw no evidence that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> would have gone on strike if the Machinists had n't. The company said it would ask the federal appeals court to reject <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' opinion, but pilots union attorneys said appellate courts historically accept such findings of fact by lower court judges. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection March 9 because of a cash crisis stemming from the walkout and pressure from creditors. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been trying to peddle the airline since then and has indicated there have been other overtures. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has been approached previously by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Machinists about making an offer, issued a statement Wednesday saying he remained interested in Eastern However, he stated, `` although I might be willing to risk my capital in Eastern, I would not be willing to pay it over to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was not available to elaborate on the statement, his secretary said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also has indicated it received a conditional offer from <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, head of the Hyatt Hotel chain, after initially getting <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s bid. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> diamond dealer said he has formed a partnership with an unidentified foreign airline that he said could raise more than $ 250 million by the end of the week for a bid. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Censor </PERSON>, 62, said he had met with officials from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to discuss his proposal for buying the strike-bound carrier. Eastern attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boies </PERSON> confirmed he met with Censor but declined to say whether the airline was taking the bid seriously. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> emerged as the buyer earlier this month and a deal appeared virtually assured, especially after his group reached labor agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s striking unions following negotiations this past weekend. But negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> began to deteriorate Tuesday, amid sometimes-heated discussions with <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> walked out of discussions at bankruptcy court that evening, hours before their self-imposed midnight deadline for reaching agreement. Under five-year deals reached with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> on Monday, the three unions _ the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and the flight attendants union _ would have received 30 percent ownership of the airline in exchange for about $ 210 million in concessions.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> moved to seize leadership in the $ 4 billion computer workstation market Wednesday, announcing an agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 476 million in cash. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s surprise announcement stole some thunder from rival <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had chosen Wednesday to announce what it called the most significant new products in its history. Apollo and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> together would have 30.4 percent of the burgeoning workstation market, capturing the lead from Sun, which has 28.3 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a San Jose-based research firm. The workstation market is expected to grow at a 30 percent clip through 1993, according to <PERSON> Alea </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION>. Workstations are single-user computers that resemble personal computers but are usually quicker, bigger and with larger screens and better graphics. They were originally used mostly by scientists and engineers but are being increasingly targeted to everyday personal and business use. `` It signals a real major commitment on our part to the workstation portion of our business,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, director of marketing in <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s computer products sector. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> will offer $ 13.12 per share for Apollo's estimated 36 million shares of common stock outstanding and will begin its tender offer within five business days Apollo shot up $ 4.62 -LCB- to $ 12.75, a gain of more than 50 percent in heavy over-the-counter trading of 10 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents to $ 53.50 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The deal requires regulatory approval and the tender of at least 51 percent of Apollo stock by shareholders. Apollo, a Fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in <LOCATION> Chelmsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was the pioneer of computer workstations, but has suffered setbacks in the race with <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> and lost money in two consecutive quarters last year. It squeezed out a profit of $ 2.1 million for the year as a whole on sales of $ 654 million. Apollo will likely operate as a division within <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s workstation group once the acquisition is completed, which should be in 90 days, said <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>. Apollo Chairman and CEO <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderslice </PERSON> termed the transaction a `` win-win'' situation for both companies. He said he did not foresee major layoffs resulting from the purchase. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> said it will benefit from Apollo's strength in computer networking and its large customer base and motivated workforce. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> will bring its strength in the graphics area to Apollo, which could use the help, as well as financial resources that includes $ 9.8 billion in revenues last year. `` The Hewlett-Apollo thing was pretty astonishing,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a senior analyst and editor of San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION>. `` What Hewlett I think is doing here is building a lot of customer relationships that they are then going to migrate over into the Unix world.'' Workstations run on Unix, an operating system that excels in communications and the ability to carry out multiple tasks simultaneously. The announcement came as <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> rolled out a line of Sparcstation computers that boast sophisticated new graphics and digital sound, plus higher speeds and a circuit board that allows full-motion video on a computer screen. It also launched a family of Sun-3 workstations. `` I think that maybe is purely coincidental but it is interesting timing,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosak </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think it buys <PERSON> Hewlett </PERSON> more visibility in an interesting market. They certainly have the money to do it and Apollo did need financial help,'' said <PERSON> Bosak </PERSON>, who called the $ 476 million a fair price. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> had 16.9 percent of the 1987-88 market share and Apollo had 13.5 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Lorenzo Tells Business Students Why Ueberroth Deal Failed</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said Wednesday he turned down <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s proposed purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> because a takeover by a trustee was bad for the airlines' shareholders <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> gave his reasons for the purchase collapse to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate students at a lecture that was closed to the media. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> offered $ 464 million for the strikebound airline and the deal for a time seemed likely until talks broke down for good over the issue of who would control the airline as it emerged from bankruptcy. Eastern's unions demanded that the courts appoint a trustee but <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> refused. `` He blamed it -LRB- the collapse -RRB- on the unions,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Danitz </PERSON>, 27. `` He felt he should have been running the airline in the interim. He felt he was better qualified being in the airline -LRB- business -RRB- than somebody who's a trustee of the court.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzari </PERSON>, 27, another student, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> gave the audience a historical perspective on the Eastern troubles and then explained `` why the <LOCATION> Uebberoth </LOCATION> deal did not fly.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told the students he wanted to `` run the company until we can pay our shareholders,'' he said. `` He said he was looking for the best deal in the interest of the shareholders. He thought hiring a trustee was not in their best interest.'' Another student who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told them he planned to sell some of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets `` and that will be better for the shareholders.'' About 100 protesters marched outside <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> spoke for 20 minutes about the airline industry since deregulation and then answered students' questions for another 40 minutes. One protester carried a sign that read, `` <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> smooth talk'59. Some things never change.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was graduated from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in 1959. The executive avoided the protesters by going through an underground entrance to address the lecture which had been scheduled since November as part of the university's Distinguished Lecture Series. <PERSON> Marie-Odile </PERSON> <PERSON> Taillard </PERSON>, chairwoman of the series, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had asked that reporters not be among the 250 to 300 graduate business students who warmly applauded him at the conclusion of his lecture. But not all the students were impressed. `` I went in there with a pretty bad impression of him and it did n't change,'' said one student, who asked not to be identified. `` He felt he was a scapegoat. He blamed everybody else for the situation. He seemed very unemotional,'' the student said. Outside, striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON>, 58, marched with other protesters as four security officers checked student identification cards at the building's front entrance. `` He's a brilliant person, a financial wizard,'' <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` But he treats his employees in a demeaning manner.'' <PERSON> Danitz </PERSON> said one student asked <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> what the students should do if they someday find themselves embroiled in a difficult labor situation. `` If it's a non-union place, do n't let them in,'' <PERSON> Danitz </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as saying. `` He said if management is doing a good job, there's no reason for unions to come in,'' <PERSON> Danitz </PERSON> said.
